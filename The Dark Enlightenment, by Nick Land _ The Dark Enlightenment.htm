<a id="part1"><strong> Part 1: Neo-reactionaries head for the exit</strong></a></p>
<p>Enlightenment is not only a state, but an event, and a process. As 
the designation for an historical episode, concentrated in northern 
Europe during the 18th century, it is a leading candidate for the âtrue 
nameâ of modernity, capturing its origin and essence (âRenaissanceâ and 
âIndustrial Revolutionâ are others). Between âenlightenmentâ and 
âprogressive enlightenmentâ there is only an elusive difference, because
 illumination takes time â and feeds on itself, because enlightenment is
 self-confirming, its revelations âself-evidentâ, and because a 
retrograde, or reactionary, âdark enlightenmentâ amounts almost to 
intrinsic contradiction. To become enlightened, in this historical 
sense, is to recognize, and then to pursue, a guiding light.</p>
<p>There were ages of darkness, and then enlightenment came. Clearly, 
advance has demonstrated itself, offering not only improvement, but also
 a model. Furthermore, unlike a renaissance, there is no need for an 
enlightenment to recall what was lost, or to emphasize the attractions 
of return. The elementary acknowledgement of enlightenment is already <em>Whig history</em> in miniature.</p>
<p>Once certain enlightened truths have been found self-evident, there 
can be no turning back, and conservatism is pre-emptively condemned â 
predestined â to paradox. F. A. Hayek, who refused to describe himself 
as a conservative, famously settled instead upon the term âOld Whigâ, 
which â like âclassical liberalâ (or the still more melancholy 
âremnantâ) â accepts that progress isnât what it used to be. What could 
an Old Whig be, if not a reactionary progressive? And what on earth is 
that?</p>
<p>Of course, plenty of people already think they know what reactionary 
modernism looks like, and amidst the current collapse back into the 
1930s their concerns are only likely to grow. Basically, itâs what the 
âFâ word is for, at least in its progressive usage. A flight from 
democracy under these circumstances conforms so perfectly to 
expectations that it eludes specific recognition, appearing merely as an
 atavism, or confirmation of dire repetition.</p>
<p>Still, something is happening, and it is â at least in part â something else. One milestone was the April 2009 <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.cato-unbound.org/archives/april-2009/">discussion</a>
 hosted at Cato Unbound among libertarian thinkers (including Patri 
Friedman and Peter Thiel) in which disillusionment with the direction 
and possibilities of democratic politics was expressed with unusual 
forthrightness. Thiel <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/04/13/peter-thiel/the-education-of-a-libertarian/">summarized</a> the trend bluntly: âI no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.â</p>
<p>In August 2011, Michael Lind posted a democratic <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.salon.com/2011/08/30/lind_libertariansim/">riposte</a> at Salon, digging up some impressively malodorous dirt, and concluding:</p>
<blockquote><p>The dread of democracy by libertarians and classical 
liberals is justified. Libertarianism really is incompatible with 
democracy. Most libertarians have made it clear which of the two they 
prefer. The only question that remains to be settled is why anyone 
should pay attention to libertarians.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lind and the âneo-reactionariesâ seem to be in broad agreement that democracy is not only (or even) a <em>system</em>, but rather a <em>vector</em>,
 with an unmistakable direction. Democracy and âprogressive democracyâ 
are synonymous, and indistinguishable from the expansion of the state. 
Whilst âextreme right wingâ governments have, on rare occasions, 
momentarily arrested this process, its reversal lies beyond the bounds 
of democratic possibility. Since winning elections is overwhelmingly a 
matter of vote buying, and societyâs informational organs (education and
 media) are no more resistant to bribery than the electorate, a thrifty 
politician is simply an incompetent politician, and the democratic 
variant of Darwinism quickly eliminates such misfits from the gene pool.
 This is a reality that the left applauds, the establishment right 
grumpily accepts, and the libertarian right has ineffectively railed 
against. Increasingly, however, libertarians have ceased to care whether
 anyone is âpay[ing them] attentionâ â they have been looking for 
something else entirely: an exit.</p>
<p>It is a structural inevitability that the libertarian voice is 
drowned out in democracy, and according to Lind it should be. Ever more 
libertarians are likely to agree. âVoiceâ is democracy itself, in its 
historically dominant, Rousseauistic strain. It models the state as a 
representation of popular will, and making oneself heard means more 
politics. If voting as the mass self-expression of politically empowered
 peoples is a nightmare engulfing the world, adding to the hubbub 
doesnât help. Even more than Equality-vs-Liberty, Voice-vs-Exit is the 
rising alternative, and libertarians are opting for voiceless flight. 
Patri Friedman <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.seasteading.org/2008/05/nothing-against-bioshock/">remarks</a>: âwe think that free exit is so important that weâve called it the only Universal Human Right.â</p>
<p>For the hardcore neo-reactionaries, democracy is not merely doomed, 
it is doom itself. Fleeing it approaches an ultimate imperative. The 
subterranean current that propels such anti-politics is recognizably 
Hobbesian, a coherent dark enlightenment, devoid from its beginning of 
any Rousseauistic enthusiasm for popular expression. Predisposed, in any
 case, to perceive the politically awakened masses as a howling 
irrational mob, it conceives the dynamics of democratization as 
fundamentally degenerative: systematically consolidating and 
exacerbating private vices, resentments, and deficiencies until they 
reach the level of collective criminality and comprehensive social 
corruption. The democratic politician and the electorate are bound 
together by a circuit of reciprocal incitement, in which each side 
drives the other to ever more shameless extremities of hooting, prancing
 cannibalism, until the only alternative to shouting is being eaten.</p>
<p>Where the progressive enlightenment sees political ideals, the dark 
enlightenment sees appetites. It accepts that governments are made out 
of people, and that they will eat well. Setting its expectations as low 
as reasonably possible, it seeks only to spare civilization from 
frenzied, ruinous, gluttonous debauch. From Thomas Hobbes to 
Hans-Hermann Hoppe and beyond, it asks: How can the sovereign power be 
prevented â or at least dissuaded â from devouring society? It 
consistently finds democratic âsolutionsâ to this problem risible, at 
best.</p>
<p>Hoppe advocates an anarcho-capitalist âprivate law societyâ, but between monarchy and democracy he does not hesitate (and his <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.thedailybell.com/1936/Anthony-Wile-with-Dr-Hans-Hermann-Hoppe-on-the-Impracticality-of-One-World-Government-and-Western-style-Democracy.html">argument</a> is strictly Hobbesian):</p>
<blockquote><p>As a hereditary monopolist, a king regards the territory 
and the people under his rule as his personal property and engages in 
the monopolistic exploitation of this âproperty.â Under democracy, 
monopoly and monopolistic exploitation do not disappear. Rather, what 
happens is this: instead of a king and a nobility who regard the country
 as their private property, a temporary and interchangeable caretaker is
 put in monopolistic charge of the country. The caretaker does not own 
the country, but as long as he is in office he is permitted to use it to
 his and his protÃ©gÃ©sâ advantage. He owns its current use â <em>usufruct</em>â
 but not its capital stock. This does not eliminate exploitation. To the
 contrary, it makes exploitation less calculating and carried out with 
little or no regard to the capital stock. Exploitation becomes 
shortsighted and capital consumption will be systematically promoted.</p></blockquote>
<p>Political agents invested with transient authority by multi-party 
democratic systems have an overwhelming (and demonstrably irresistible) 
incentive to plunder society with the greatest possible rapidity and 
comprehensiveness. Anything they neglect to steal â or âleave on the 
tableâ â is likely to be inherited by political successors who are not 
only unconnected, but actually opposed, and who can therefore be 
expected to utilize all available resources to the detriment of their 
foes. Whatever is left behind becomes a weapon in your enemyâs hand. 
Best, then, to destroy what cannot be stolen. From the perspective of a 
democratic politician, any type of social good that is neither directly 
appropriable nor attributable to (their own) partisan policy is sheer 
waste, and counts for nothing, whilst even the most grievous social 
misfortune â so long as it can be assigned to a prior administration or 
postponed until a subsequent one â figures in rational calculations as 
an obvious blessing. The long-range techno-economic improvements and 
associated accumulation of cultural capital that constituted social 
progress in its old (Whig) sense are in nobodyâs political interest. 
Once democracy flourishes, they face the immediate threat of extinction.</p>
<p>Civilization, as a process, is indistinguishable from diminishing 
time-preference (or declining concern for the present in comparison to 
the future). Democracy, which both in theory and evident historical fact
 accentuates time-preference to the point of convulsive feeding-frenzy, 
is thus as close to a precise negation of civilization as anything could
 be, short of instantaneous social collapse into murderous barbarism or 
zombie apocalypse (which it eventually leads to). As the democratic 
virus burns through society, painstakingly accumulated habits and 
attitudes of forward-thinking, prudential, human and industrial 
investment, are replaced by a sterile, orgiastic consumerism, financial 
incontinence, and a âreality televisionâ political circus. Tomorrow 
might belong to the other team, so itâs best to eat it all now.</p>
<p>Winston Churchill, who remarked in neo-reactionary style that âthe 
best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the 
average voterâ is better known for suggesting âthat democracy is the 
worst form of government except all the others that have been tried.â 
Whilst never exactly conceding that âOK, democracy sucks (in fact, it <em>really</em>
 sucks), but whatâs the alternative?â the implication is obvious. The 
general tenor of this sensibility is attractive to modern conservatives,
 because it resonates with their wry, disillusioned acceptance of 
relentless civilizational deterioration, and with the associated 
intellectual apprehension of capitalism as an unappetizing but 
ineliminable default social arrangement, which remains after all 
catastrophic or merely impractical alternatives have been discarded. The
 market economy, on this understanding, is no more than a spontaneous 
survival strategy that stitches itself together amidst the ruins of a 
politically devastated world. Things will probably just get worse 
forever. So it goes.</p>
<p>So, what is the alternative? (Thereâs certainly no point trawling 
through the 1930s for one.) âCan you imagine a 21st-century 
post-demotist society? One that saw itself as recovering from democracy,
 much as Eastern Europe sees itself as recovering from Communism?â asks 
supreme Sith Lord of the neo-reactionaries, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/">Mencius Moldbug</a>. âWell, I suppose that makes one of us.â</p>
<p>Moldbugâs formative influences are Austro-libertarian, but thatâs all over. As he explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>â¦ libertarians cannot present a realistic picture of a 
world in which their battle gets won and stays won. They wind up looking
 for ways to push a world in which the Stateâs natural downhill path is 
to grow, back up the hill. This prospect is Sisyphean, and itâs 
understandable why it attracts so few supporters.</p></blockquote>
<p>His awakening into neo-reaction comes with the (Hobbesian) 
recognition that sovereignty cannot be eliminated, caged, or controlled.
 Anarcho-capitalist utopias can never condense out of science fiction, 
divided powers flow back together like a shattered Terminator, and 
constitutions have exactly as much real authority as a sovereign 
interpretative power allows them to have. The state isnât going anywhere
 because â to those who run it â itâs worth far too much to give up, and
 as the concentrated instantiation of sovereignty in society, nobody can
 make it do anything. If the state cannot be eliminated, Moldbug argues,
 at least it can be cured of <em>democracy</em> (or systematic and degenerative bad government), and the way to do that is to <em>formalize</em> it. This is an approach he calls âneo-cameralismâ.</p>
<blockquote><p>To a neocameralist, a state is a business which owns a 
country. A state should be managed, like any other large business, by 
dividing logical ownership into negotiable shares, each of which yields a
 precise fraction of the stateâs profit. (A well-run state is very 
profitable.) Each share has one vote, and the shareholders elect a 
board, which hires and fires managers.</p>
<p>This businessâs customers are its residents. A profitably-managed 
neocameralist state will, like any business, serve its customers 
efficiently and effectively. Misgovernment equals mismanagement.</p></blockquote>
<p>Firstly, it is essential to squash the democratic myth that a state 
âbelongsâ to the citizenry. The point of neo-cameralism is to buy out 
the real stakeholders in sovereign power, not to perpetuate sentimental 
lies about mass enfranchisement. Unless ownership of the state is 
formally transferred into the hands of its actual rulers, the 
neo-cameral transition will simply not take place, power will remain in 
the shadows, and the democratic farce will continue.</p>
<p>So, secondly, the ruling class must be plausibly identified. It 
should be noted immediately, in contradistinction to Marxist principles 
of social analysis, that this is not the âcapitalist bourgeoisieâ. 
Logically, it cannot be. The power of the business class is already 
clearly formalized, in monetary terms, so the identification of capital 
with political power is perfectly redundant. It is necessary to ask, 
rather, <em>who do capitalists pay for political favors</em>, how much 
these favors are potentially worth, and how the authority to grant them 
is distributed. This requires, with a minimum of moral irritation, that 
the entire social landscape of political bribery (âlobbyingâ) is exactly
 mapped, and the administrative, legislative, judicial, media, and 
academic privileges accessed by such bribes are converted into fungible 
shares. Insofar as voters are worth bribing, there is no need to 
entirely exclude them from this calculation, although their portion of 
sovereignty will be estimated with appropriate derision. The conclusion 
of this exercise is the mapping of a ruling entity that is the truly 
dominant instance of the democratic polity. Moldbug calls it the <em>Cathedral</em>.</p>
<p>The formalization of political powers, thirdly, allows for the 
possibility of effective government. Once the universe of democratic 
corruption is converted into a (freely transferable) shareholding in <em>gov-corp</em>.
 the owners of the state can initiate rational corporate governance, 
beginning with the appointment of a CEO. As with any business, the 
interests of the state are now precisely formalized as the maximization 
of long-term shareholder value. There is no longer any need for 
residents (clients) to take any interest in politics whatsoever. In 
fact, to do so would be to exhibit semi-criminal proclivities. If <em>gov-corp</em>
 doesnât deliver acceptable value for its taxes (sovereign rent), they 
can notify its customer service function, and if necessary take their 
custom elsewhere. <em>Gov-corp</em> would concentrate upon running an 
efficient, attractive, vital, clean, and secure country, of a kind that 
is able to draw customers. No voice, free exit.</p>
<blockquote><p>â¦ although the full neocameralist approach has never been
 tried, its closest historical equivalents to this approach are the 
18th-century tradition of enlightened absolutism as represented by 
Frederick the Great, and the 21st-century nondemocratic tradition as 
seen in lost fragments of the British Empire such as Hong Kong, 
Singapore and Dubai. These states appear to provide a very high quality 
of service to their citizens, with no meaningful democracy at all. They 
have minimal crime and high levels of personal and economic freedom. 
They tend to be quite prosperous. They are weak only in political 
freedom, and political freedom is unimportant by definition when 
government is stable and effective.</p></blockquote>
<p>In European classical antiquity, democracy was recognized as a 
familiar phase of cyclical political development, fundamentally decadent
 in nature, and preliminary to a slide into tyranny. Today this 
classical understanding is thoroughly lost, and replaced by a global 
democratic ideology, entirely lacking in critical self-reflection, that 
is asserted not as a credible social-scientific thesis, or even as a 
spontaneous popular aspiration, but rather as a religious creed, of a

<blockquote><p>â¦ a received tradition I call Universalism, which is a 
nontheistic Christian sect. Some other current labels for this same 
tradition, more or less synonymous, are progressivism, multiculturalism,
 liberalism, humanism, leftism, political correctness, and the like. â¦ 
Universalism is the dominant modern branch of Christianity on the 
Calvinist line, evolving from the English Dissenter or Puritan tradition
 through the Unitarian, Transcendentalist, and Progressive movements. 
Its ancestral briar patch also includes a few sideways sprigs that are 
important enough to name but whose Christian ancestry is slightly better
 concealed, such as Rousseauvian laicism, Benthamite utilitarianism, 
Reformed Judaism, Comtean positivism, German Idealism, Marxist 
scientific socialism, Sartrean existentialism, Heideggerian 
postmodernism, etc, etc, etc. â¦ Universalism, in my opinion, is best 
described as a <em>mystery cult of power</em>. â¦ Itâs as hard to imagine
 Universalism without the State as malaria without the mosquito. â¦ The 
point is that this thing, whatever you care to call it, is at least two 
hundred years old and probably more like five. Itâs basically the 
Reformation itself. â¦ And just walking up to it and denouncing it as 
evil is about as likely to work as suing Shub-Niggurath in small-claims 
court.</p></blockquote>

<p>Googling âdemocracyâ and âlibertyâ together is highly enlightening, 
in a dark way. In cyberspace, at least, it is clear that only a distinct
 minority think of these terms as positively coupled. If opinion is to 
be judged in terms of the Google spider and its digital prey, by far the
 most prevalent association is disjunctive, or antagonistic, drawing 
upon the reactionary insight that democracy poses a lethal menace to 
liberty, all but ensuring its eventual eradication. Democracy is to 
liberty as Gargantua to a pie (âSurely you can see that we love liberty,
 to the point of gut-rumbling and salivation â¦â).</p>
<p>Steve H. Hanke lays out the case authoritatively in his short <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/democracy-versus-liberty">essay</a> <em>On Democracy Versus Liberty</em>, focused upon the American experience:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most people, including most Americans, would be surprised
 to learn that the word âdemocracyâ does not appear in the Declaration 
of Independence (1776) or the Constitution of the United States of 
America (1789). They would also be shocked to learn the reason for the 
absence of the word democracy in the founding documents of the U.S.A. 
Contrary to what propaganda has led the public to believe, Americaâs 
Founding Fathers were skeptical and anxious about democracy. They were 
aware of the evils that accompany a tyranny of the majority. The Framers
 of the Constitution went to great lengths to ensure that the federal 
government was not based on the will of the majority and was not, 
therefore, democratic.</p>
<p>If the Framers of the Constitution did not embrace democracy, what 
did they adhere to? To a man, the Framers agreed that the purpose of 
government was to secure citizens in John Lockeâs trilogy of the rights 
to life, liberty and property.</p></blockquote>
<p>He elaborates:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Constitution is primarily a structural and procedural
 document that itemizes who is to exercise power and how they are to 
exercise it. A great deal of stress is placed on the separation of 
powers and the checks and balances in the system. These were not a 
Cartesian construct or formula aimed at social engineering, but a shield
 to protect the people from the government. In short, the Constitution 
was designed to govern the government, not the people.</p>
<p>The Bill of Rights establishes the rights of the people against 
infringements by the State. The only thing that the citizens can demand 
from the State, under the Bill of Rights, is for a trial by a jury. The 
rest of the citizensâ rights are protections from the State. For roughly
 a century after the Constitution was ratified, private property, 
contracts and free internal trade within the United States were sacred. 
The scope and scale of the government remained very constrained. All 
this was very consistent with what was understood to be liberty.</p></blockquote>
<p>As the spirit of reaction digs its Sith-tentacles into the brain, it 
becomes difficult to remember how the classical (or non-communist) 
progressive narrative could once have made sense. What were people 
thinking? What were they expecting from the emerging super-empowered, 
populist, cannibalistic state? Wasnât the eventual calamity entirely 
predictable? How was it ever possible to be a Whig?</p>
<p>The ideological credibility of radical democratization is not, of 
course, in question. As thinkers ranging from (Christian progressive) 
Walter Russell Mead to (atheistic reactionary) Mencius Moldbug have 
exhaustively detailed, it conforms so exactly to ultra-protestant 
religious enthusiasm that its power to animate the revolutionary soul 
should surprise nobody. Within just a few years of Martin Lutherâs 
challenge to the papal establishment, peasant insurrectionists were 
stringing up their class enemies all over Germany.</p>
<p>The empirical credibility of democratic advancement is far more 
perplexing, and also genuinely complex (which is to say controversial, 
or more precisely, worthy of a data-based, rigorously-argued 
controversy). In part, that is because the modern configuration of 
democracy emerges within the sweep of a far broader modernistic trend, 
whose techno-scientific, economic, social and political strands are 
obscurely interrelated, knitted together by misleading correlations, and
 subsequent false causalities. If, as Schumpeter argues, industrial 
capitalism tends to engender a democratic-bureaucratic culture that 
concludes in stagnation, it might nevertheless seem as though democracy 
was âassociatedâ with material progress. It is easy to misconstrue a 
lagging indicator as a positive causal factor, especially when 
ideological zeal lends its bias to the misapprehension. In similar vein,
 since cancer only afflicts living beings, it might â with apparent 
reason â be associated with vitality.</p>
<p>Robin Hanson (gently) <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.overcomingbias.com/2012/02/is-pessimism-immoral.html">notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes many trends have been positive for a century or so, 
and yes this suggests they will continue to rise for a century or so. 
But no this does not mean that students are empirically or morally wrong
 for thinking it âutopian fantasyâ that one could âend poverty, disease,
 tyranny, and warâ by joining a modern-day Kennedyâs political quest. 
Why? Because positive recent trends in these areas were not much caused 
by such political movements! They were mostly caused by our getting rich
 from the industrial revolution, an event that political movements 
tended, if anything, to try to hold back on average.</p></blockquote>
<p>Simple historical chronology suggests that industrialization supports
 progressive democratization, rather than being derived from it. This 
observation has even given rise to a widely accepted school of pop 
social science theorizing, according to which the âmaturationâ of 
societies in a democratic direction is determined by thresholds of 
affluence, or middle-class formation. The strict logical correlate of 
such ideas, that democracy is <em>fundamentally non-productive</em> in relation to material progress, is typically under-emphasized. Democracy <em>consumes</em>
 progress. When perceived from the perspective of the dark 
enlightenment, the appropriate mode of analysis for studying the 
democratic phenomenon is general parasitology.</p>
<p>Quasi-libertarian responses to the outbreak accept this implicitly. 
Given a population deeply infected by the zombie virus and shambling 
into cannibalistic social collapse, the preferred option is quarantine. 
It is not communicative isolation that is essential, but a functional 
dis-solidarization of society that tightens feedback loops and exposes 
people with maximum intensity to the consequences of their own actions. 
Social solidarity, in precise contrast, is the parasiteâs friend. By 
cropping out all high-frequency feedback mechanisms (such as market 
signals), and replacing them with sluggish, infra-red loops that pass 
through a centralized forum of âgeneral willâ, a radically democratized 
society insulates parasitism from what it does, transforming local, 
painfully dysfunctional, intolerable, and thus urgently corrected 
behavior patterns into global, numbed, and chronic socio-political 
pathologies.</p>
<p><em>Gnaw off other peopleâs body parts and it might be hard to get a job</em>  â  thatâs the kind of lesson a tight-feedback, cybernetically intense, <em>laissez faire</em>
 order would allow to be learned. Itâs also exactly the kind of 
insensitive zombiphobic discrimination that any compassionate democracy 
would denounce as thought crime, whilst boosting the public budget for 
the vitally-challenged, undertaking consciousness raising campaigns on 
behalf of those suffering from involuntary cannibalistic impulse 
syndrome, affirming the dignity of the zombie lifestyle in 
higher-education curriculums, and rigorously regulating workspaces to 
ensure that the shuffling undead are not victimized by profit-obsessed, 
performance-centric, or even unreconstructed animationist employers.</p>
<p>As enlightened zombie-tolerance flourishes in the shelter of the 
democratic mega-parasite, a small remnant of reactionaries, attentive to
 the effects of real incentives, raise the formulaic question: âYou do 
realize that these policies lead inevitably to a massive expansion of 
the zombie population?â The dominant vector of history presupposes that 
such nuisance objections are marginalized, ignored, and â wherever 
possible â silenced through social ostracism. The remnant either 
fortifies the basement, whilst stocking up on dried food, ammunition, 
and silver coins, or accelerates the application process for a second 
passport, and starts packing its bags.</p>
<p>If all of this seems to be coming unmoored from historical 
concreteness, thereâs a conveniently topical remedy: a little digressive
 channel-hopping over to Greece. As a microcosmic model for the death of
 the West, playing out in real time, the Greek story is hypnotic. It 
describes a 2,500 year arc that is far from neat, but irresistibly 
dramatic, from proto-democracy to accomplished zombie apocalypse. Its 
pre-eminent virtue is that it perfectly illustrates the democratic 
mechanism <em>in extremis</em>, separating individuals and local 
populations from the consequences of their decisions by scrambling their
 behavior through large-scale, centralized re-distribution systems. You 
decide what you do, but then vote on the consequences. How could anyone 
say ânoâ to that?</p>
<p>No surprise that over 30 years of EU membership Greeks have been 
eagerly cooperating with a social-engineering mega-project that strips 
out all short-wave social signals and re-routes feedback through the 
grandiose circuitry of European solidarity, ensuring that all 
economically-relevant information is red-shifted through the heat-death 
sump of the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.zerohedge.com/news/ex-ecbs-juergen-stark-says-ecbs-balance-sheet-gigantic-collateral-quality-shocking">European Central Bank</a>.
 Most specifically, it has conspired with âEuropeâ to obliterate all 
information that might be contained in Greek interest rates, thus 
effectively disabling all financial feedback on domestic policy choices.</p>
<p>This is democracy in a consummate form that defies further 
perfection, since nothing conforms more exactly to the âgeneral willâ 
than the legislative abolition of reality, and nothing delivers the 
hemlock to reality more definitively than the coupling of Teutonic 
interest rates with East Mediterranean spending decisions. <em>Live like Hellenes and pay like Germans</em>
 â any political party that failed to rise to power on that platform 
deserves to scrabble for vulture-picked scraps in the wilderness. Itâs 
the ultimate <em>no-brainer</em>, in just about every imaginable sense of that expression. What could possibly go wrong?</p>
<p>More to the point, what did go wrong? Mencius Moldbug begins his <em>Unqualified Reservations</em> series How Dawkins got pwned (or taken over through an âexploitable vulnerabilityâ) with the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/09/how-dawkins-got-pwned-part-1.html">outlining</a>
 of design rules for a hypothetical âoptimal memetic parasiteâ that 
would be âas virulent as possible. It will be highly contagious, highly 
morbid, and highly persistent. A really ugly bug.â In comparison to this
 ideological super-plague, the vestigial monotheism derided in <em>The God Delusion</em>
 would figure as nothing worse than a moderately unpleasant head cold. 
What begins as abstract meme tinkering concludes as grand-sweep history,
 in the dark enlightenment <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/10/how-dawkins-got-pwned-part-2.html">mode</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>My belief is that Professor Dawkins is not just a Christian atheist. He is a <em>Protestant atheist</em>. And he is not just a Protestant atheist. He is a <em>Calvinist atheist</em>. And he is not just a Calvinist atheist. He is an <em>Anglo-Calvinist atheist</em>.
 In other words, he can be also described as a Puritan atheist, a 
Dissenter atheist, a Nonconformist atheist, an Evangelical atheist, etc,
 etc.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This cladistic taxonomy traces Professor Dawkinsâ intellectual ancestry 
back about 400 years, to the era of the English Civil War. Except of 
course for the atheism theme, Professor Dawkinsâ kernel is a remarkable 
match for the Ranter, Leveller, Digger, Quaker, Fifth Monarchist, or any
 of the more extreme English Dissenter traditions that flourished during
 the Cromwellian interregnum.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Frankly, these dudes were freaks. Maniacal fanatics. Any mainstream 
English thinker of the 17th, 18th or 19th century, informed that this 
tradition (or its modern descendant) is now the planetâs dominant 
Christian denomination, would regard this as a sign of imminent 
apocalypse. If youâre sure theyâre wrong, youâre more sure than me.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Fortunately, Cromwell himself was comparatively moderate. The extreme 
ultra-Puritan sects never got a solid lock on power under the 
Protectorate. Even more fortunately, Cromwell got old and died, and 
Cromwellism died with him. Lawful government was restored to Great 
Britain, as was the Church of England, and Dissenters became a marginal 
fringe again. And frankly, a damned good riddance it was.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
However, you canât keep a good parasite down. A community of Puritans 
fled to America and founded the theocratic colonies of New England. 
After its military victories in the American Rebellion and the War of 
Secession, American Puritanism was well on the way to world domination. 
Its victories in World War I, World War II, and the Cold War confirmed 
its global hegemony. All legitimate mainstream thought on Earth today is
 descended from the American Puritans, and through them the English 
Dissenters.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given the rise of this âreally ugly bugâ to world dominion, it might 
seem strange to pick on tangential figure such as Dawkins, but Moldbug 
selects his target for exquisitely-judged strategic reasons. Moldbug 
identifies with Dawkinsâ Darwinism, with his intellectual repudiation of
 Abrahamic theism, and with his broad commitment to scientific 
rationality. Yet he recognizes, crucially, that Dawkinsâ critical 
faculties shut off â abruptly and often comically â at the point where 
they might endanger a still broader commitment to hegemonic 
progressivism. In this way, Dawkins is powerfully indicative. Militant 
secularism is itself a modernized variant of the Abrahamic meta-meme, on
 its Anglo-Protestant, radical democratic taxonomic branch, <em>whose specific tradition is anti-traditionalism</em>. The clamorous atheism of <em>The God Delusion</em>
 represents a protective feint, and a consistent upgrade of religious 
reformation, guided by a spirit of progressive enthusiasm that trumps 
empiricism and reason, whilst exemplifying an irritable dogmatism that 
rivals anything to be found in earlier God-themed strains.</p>
<p>Dawkins isnât merely an enlightened modern progressive and implicit 
radical democrat, heâs an impressively credentialed scientist, more 
specifically a biologist, and (thus) a Darwinian evolutionist. The point
 at which he touches the limit of acceptable thinking as defined by the 
memetic super-bug is therefore quite easy to anticipate. His inherited 
tradition of low-church ultra-protestantism has replaced God with Man as
 the locus of spiritual investment, and âManâ has been in the process of
 Darwinian research dissolution for over 150 years. (As the sound, 
decent person I know you are, having gotten this far with Moldbug youâre
 probably already muttering under your breath, <em>donât mention race, 
donât mention race, donât mention race, please, oh please, in the name 
of the Zeitgeist and the dear sweet non-god of progress, donât mention 
race â¦</em>) â¦ but Moldbug is <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/10/how-dawkins-got-pwned-part-3.html">already</a>
 citing Dawkins, citing Thomas Huxley ââ¦in a contest which is to be 
carried out by thoughts and not by bites. The highest places in the 
hierarchy of civilization will assuredly not be within the reach of our 
dusky cousins.â Which Dawkins frames by remarking: âHad Huxleyâ¦ been 
born and educated in our time, [he] would have been the first to cringe 
with us at [his] Victorian sentiments and unctuous tone. I quote them 
only to illustrate how the <em>Zeitgeist</em> moves on.â</p>
<p>It gets worse. Moldbug seems to be holding Huxleyâs hand, and â¦ 
(ewww!) doing that palm-stroking thing with his finger. This sure ainât 
vanilla-libertarian reaction anymore â itâs getting seriously dark, and 
scary. âIn all seriousness, what is the evidence for fraternism? Why, 
exactly, does Professor Dawkins believe that all neohominids are born 
with identical potential for neurological development? He doesnât say. 
Perhaps he thinks itâs obvious.â</p>
<p>Whatever oneâs opinion on the respective scientific merits of human 
biological diversity or uniformity, it is surely beyond contention that 
the latter assumption, alone, is <em>tolerated</em>. Even if 
progressive-universalistic beliefs about human nature are true, they are
 not held because they are true, or arrived at through any process that 
passes the laugh test for critical scientific rationality. They are 
received as religious tenets, with all of the passionate intensity that 
characterizes essential items of faith, and to question them is not a 
matter of scientific inaccuracy, but of what we now call <em>political incorrectness</em>, and once knew as <em>heresy</em>.</p>
<p>To sustain this transcendent moral posture in relation to <em>racism</em> is no more rational than subscription to the doctrine of <em>original sin</em>,
 of which it is, in any case, the unmistakable modern substitute. The 
difference, of course, is that âoriginal sinâ is a traditional doctrine,
 subscribed to by an embattled social cohort, significantly 
under-represented among public intellectuals and media figures, deeply 
unfashionable in the dominant world culture, and widely criticized â if 
not derided â without any immediate assumption that the critic is 
advocating murder, theft, or adultery. To question the status of racism 
as the supreme and defining social sin, on the other hand, is to court 
universal condemnation from social elites, and to arouse suspicions of <em>thought crimes</em> that range from pro-slavery apologetics to genocide fantasies. Racism is <em>pure or absolute evil</em>,
 whose proper sphere is the infinite and the eternal, or the incendiary 
sinful depths of the hyper-protestant soul, rather than the mundane 
confines of civil interaction, social scientific realism, or efficient 
and proportional legality. The dissymmetry of affect, sanction, and raw 
social power attending old heresies and their replacements, once 
noticed, is a nagging indicator. A new sect reigns, and it is not even 
especially well hidden.</p>
<p>Yet even among the most hardened HBD constituencies, hysterical 
sanctification of plus-good race-think hardly suffices to lend radical 
democracy the aura of profound morbidity that Moldbug detects. That 
requires a devotional relation to the State.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a id="part3"><strong> Part 3:</strong></a></p>
<p>The previous installment of this series ended with our hero Mencius 
Moldbug, up to his waist (or worse) in the mephitic swamp of political 
incorrectness, approaching the dark heart of his politico-religious 
meditation on <em>How Dawkins Got Pwned</em>. Moldbug has caught Dawkins
 in the midst of a symptomatically significant, and excruciatingly 
sanctimonious, denunciation of Thomas Huxleyâs racist âVictorian 
sentimentsâ â a sermon which concludes with the strange declaration that
 he is quoting Huxleyâs words, despite their self-evident and wholly 
intolerable ghastliness, âonly to illustrate how the <em>Zeitgeist</em> moves on.â</p>
<p>Moldbug <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/10/how-dawkins-got-pwned-part-3.html">pounces</a>,
 asking pointedly: âWhat, exactly, is this Zeitgeist thing?â It is, 
indisputably, an extraordinary catch. Here is a thinker (Dawkins), 
trained as a biologist, and especially fascinated by the (disjunctively)
 twinned topics of naturalistic evolution and Abrahamic religion, 
stumbling upon what he apprehends as a one-way trend of world-historical
 spiritual development, which he then â emphatically, but without the 
slightest appeal to disciplined reason or evidence â denies has any 
serious connection to the advance of science, human biology, or 
religious tradition. The stammering nonsense that results is a thing of 
wonder, but for Moldbug it all makes sense:</p>
<blockquote><p>In fact, Professor Dawkinsâ <em>Zeitgeist</em> is â¦ indistinguishable from â¦ the old Anglo-Calvinist or Puritan concept of <em>Providence</em>. Perhaps this is a false match. But itâs quite a close one.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Another word for <em>Zeitgeist</em> is <em>Progress</em>. Itâs unsurprising that Universalists tend to believe in Progress- in fact, in a political context, they often call themselves <em>progressives</em>.
 Universalism has indeed made quite a bit of progress since [the time of
 Huxleyâs embarrassing remark in] 1913. But this hardly refutes the 
proposition that Universalism is a parasitic tradition. Progress for the
 tick is not progress for the dog.</p></blockquote>
<p>What, exactly, is this <em>Zeitgeist</em> thing? The question bears 
repeating. Is it not astounding, to begin with, that when one English 
Darwinian reaches for a weapon to club another, the most convenient 
cudgel to hand should be a German word â associated with an abstruse 
lineage of state-worshipping idealistic philosophy â explicitly 
referencing a conception of historical time that has no discernible 
connection to the process of naturalistic evolution? It is as if, 
scarcely imaginably, during a comparable contention among physicists (on
 the topic of quantum indeterminacy), one should suddenly hear it 
shouted that âGod does not play dice with the universe.â In fact, the 
two examples are intimately entangled, since Dawkinsâ faith in the <em>Zeitgeist</em> is combined with adherence to the dogmatic progressivism of âEinsteinian Religionâ (meticulously <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/09/how-dawkins-got-pwned-part-1.html">dissected</a>, of course, by Moldbug).</p>
<p>The shamelessness is remarkable, or at least it would be, were it 
naively believed that the protocols of scientific rationality occupied 
sovereign position in such disputation, if only in principle. In fact â 
and here irony is amplified to the very brink of howling psychosis â 
Einsteinâs Old One still reigns. The criteria of judgment owe everything
 to neo-puritan spiritual hygiene, and nothing whatsoever to testable 
reality. Scientific utterance is screened for conformity to a 
progressive social agenda, whose authority seems to be unaffected by its
 complete indifference to scientific integrity. It reminds Moldbug of 
Lysenko, for understandable reasons.</p>
<p>âIf the facts do not agree with the theory, so much worse for the factsâ Hegel asserted. It is the <em>Zeitgeist</em>
 that is God, historically incarnated in the state, trampling mere data 
back into the dirt. By now, everybody knows where this ends. An 
egalitarian moral ideal, hardened into a universal axiom or increasingly
 incontestable dogma, completes modernityâs supreme historical irony by 
making âtoleranceâ the iron criterion for the limits of (cultural) 
toleration. Once it is accepted universally, or, speaking more 
practically, by all social forces wielding significant cultural power, 
that <em>intolerance is intolerable</em>, political authority has legitimated anything and everything convenient to itself, without restraint.</p>
<p>That is the magic of the dialectic, or of logical perversity. When only <em>tolerance is tolerable</em>,
 and everyone (who matters) accepts this manifestly nonsensical formula 
as not only rationally intelligible, but as the universally-affirmed 
principle of modern democratic faith, nothing except politics remains. 
Perfect tolerance and absolute intolerance have become logically 
indistinguishable, with either equally interpretable as the other, A = 
not-A, or the inverse, and in the nakedly Orwellian world that results, 
power alone holds the keys of articulation. Tolerance has progressed to 
such a degree that it has become a social police function, providing the
 existential pretext for new inquisitional institutions. (âWe must 
remember that those who tolerate intolerance abuse tolerance itself, and
 an enemy of tolerance is an enemy of democracy,â Moldbug <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2011/07/petition-against-reactosphere.html">ironizes</a>.)</p>
<p>The spontaneous tolerance that characterized classical liberalism, 
rooted in a modest set of strictly negative rights that restricted the 
domain of politics, or government intolerance, surrenders during the 
democratic surge-tide to a positive <em>right to be tolerated</em>, 
defined ever more expansively as substantial entitlement, encompassing 
public affirmations of dignity, state-enforced guarantees of equal 
treatment by all agents (public and private), government protections 
against non-physical slights and humiliations, economic subsidies, and â
 ultimately â statistically proportional representation within all 
fields of employment, achievement, and recognition. That the 
eschatological culmination of this trend is simply impossible matters 
not at all to the dialectic. On the contrary, it energizes the political
 process, combusting any threat of policy satiation in the fuel of 
infinite grievance. âI will not cease from Mental Fight, Nor shall my 
Sword sleep in my hand: Till we have built Jerusalem, In Englandâs green
 and pleasant land.â Somewhere before Jerusalem is reached, the 
inarticulate pluralism of a free society has been transformed into the 
assertive multiculturalism of a soft-totalitarian democracy.</p>
<p>The Jews of 17th-century Amsterdam, or the Huguenots of 18th-century 
London, enjoyed the right to be left alone, and enriched their host 
societies in return. The democratically-empowered grievance groups of 
later modern times are incited by political leaders to demand a 
(fundamentally illiberal) <em>right to be heard</em>, with social 
consequences that are predominantly malignant. For politicians, however,
 who identify and promote themselves as the voice of the unheard and the
 ignored, the self-interest at stake could hardly be more obvious.</p>
<p>Tolerance, which once presupposed neglect, now decries it, and in so 
doing becomes its opposite. Were this a partisan development, partisan 
politics of a democratic kind might sustain the possibility of 
reversion, but it is nothing of the kind. âWhen someone is hurting, 
government has got to moveâ declared âcompassionate conservativeâ US 
President George W. Bush, in a futile effort to channel the Cathedral. 
When the ârightâ sounds like this it is not only dead, but unmistakably 
reeking of advanced decomposition. âProgressâ has won, but is that bad? 
Moldbug <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/10/how-dawkins-got-pwned-part-2.html">approaches</a> the question rigorously:</p>
<blockquote><p>If a tradition causes its hosts to make miscalculations 
that compromise their personal goals, it exhibits Misesian morbidity. If
 it causes its hosts to act in ways that compromise their genesâ 
reproductive interests, it exhibits Darwinian morbidity. If subscribing 
to the tradition is individually advantageous or neutral (defectors are 
rewarded, or at least unpunished) but collectively harmful, the 
tradition is parasitic. If subscribing is individually disadvantageous 
but collectively beneficial, the tradition is altruistic. If it is both 
individually and collectively benign, it is symbiotic. If it is both 
individually and collectively harmful, it is malignant. Each of these 
labels can be applied to either Misesian or Darwinian morbidity. A theme
 that is arational, but does not exhibit either Misesian or Darwinian 
morbidity, is trivially morbid.</p></blockquote>
<p>Behaviorally considered, the Misesian and Darwinian systems are 
clusters of âselfishâ incentives, oriented respectively to property 
accumulation and gene propagation. Whilst the Darwinians conceive the 
âMisesianâ sphere as a special case of genetically self-interested 
motivation, the Austrian tradition, rooted in highly rationalized 
neo-kantian anti-naturalism, is pre-disposed to resist such 
reductionism. Whilst the ultimate implications of this contest are 
considerable, under current conditions it is a squabble of minor 
urgency, since both formations are united in âhateâ, which is to say, in
 their reactionary tolerance for incentive structures that punish the 
maladapted.</p>
<p>âHateâ is a word to pause over. It testifies with special clarity to 
the religious orthodoxy of the Cathedral, and its peculiarities merit 
careful notice. Perhaps its most remarkable feature is its perfect 
redundancy, when evaluated from the perspective of any analysis of legal
 and cultural norms that is not enflamed by neo-puritan evangelical 
enthusiasm. A âhate crimeâ, if it is anything at all, is just a crime, 
plus âhateâ, and what the âhateâ adds is telling. To restrict ourselves,
 momentarily, to examples of uncontroversial criminality, one might ask:
 what is it exactly that <em>aggravates</em> a murder, or assault, if 
the motivation is attributed to âhateâ? Two factors seem especially 
prominent, and neither has any obvious connection to common legal norms.</p>
<p>Firstly, the crime is augmented by a purely ideational, ideological, 
or even âspiritualâ element, attesting not only to a violation of 
civilized conduct, but also to a heretical intention. This facilitates 
the complete abstraction of hate from criminality, whereupon it takes 
the form of âhate-speechâ or simply âhateâ (which is always to be 
contrasted with the âpassionâ, âoutrageâ, or righteous âangerâ 
represented by critical, controversial, or merely abusive language 
directed against unprotected groups, social categories, or individuals).
 âHateâ is an offense against the Cathedral itself, a refusal of its 
spiritual guidance, and a mental act of defiance against the manifest 
religious destiny of the world.</p>
<p>Secondly, and relatedly, âhateâ is deliberately and even 
strategically asymmetrical in respect to the equilibrium political 
polarity of advanced democratic societies. Between the relentless march 
of progress and the ineffective grouching of conservatism it does not 
vacillate. As we have seen, only the right can âhateâ. As the 
doxological immunity system of âhateâ suppression is consolidated within
 elite educational and media systems, the highly selective distribution 
of protections ensures that âdiscourseâ â especially empowered discourse
 â is ratcheted consistently to the left, which is to say, in the 
direction of an ever more comprehensively radicalized Universalism. The 
morbidity of this trend is extreme.</p>
<p>Because grievance status is awarded as political compensation for 
economic incompetence, it constructs an automatic cultural mechanism 
that advocates for dysfunction. The Universalist creed, with its reflex 
identification of inequality with injustice, can conceive no alternative
 to the proposition that the lower oneâs situation or status, the more 
compelling is oneâs claim upon society, the purer and nobler oneâs 
cause. Temporal failure is the sign of spiritual election 
(Marxo-Calvinism), and to dispute any of this is clearly âhateâ.</p>
<p>This does not compel even the most hard-hearted neo-reactionary to 
suggest, in a caricature of the high Victorian cultural style, that 
social disadvantage, as manifested in political violence, criminality, 
homelessness, insolvency, and welfare dependency, is a simple index of 
moral culpability. In large part â perhaps overwhelmingly large part â 
it reflects sheer misfortune. Dim, impulsive, unhealthy, and 
unattractive people, reared chaotically in abusive families, and 
stranded in broken, crime-wracked communities, have every reason to 
curse the gods before themselves. Besides, disaster can strike anyone.</p>
<p>In regards to effective incentive structures, however, none of this 
is of the slightest importance. Behavioral reality knows only one iron 
law: <strong>Whatever is subsidized is promoted</strong>. With a 
necessity no weaker than that of entropy itself, insofar as social 
democracy seeks to soften bad consequences â for major corporations no 
less than for struggling individuals or hapless cultures â things get 
worse. There is no way around, or beyond this formula, only wishful 
thinking, and complicity with degeneration. Of course, this defining 
reactionary insight is doomed to inconsequence, since it amounts to the 
supremely unpalatable conclusion that every attempt at âprogressiveâ 
improvement is fated to reverse itself, âperverselyâ, into horrible 
failure. No democracy could accept this, which means that every 
democracy will fail.</p>
<p>The excited spiral of Misesian-Darwinian degenerative runaway is neatly captured in the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/04/europe-8217-s-real-crisis/8915/">words</a> of the worldâs fluffiest Beltway libertarian, Megan McArdle, writing in core Cathedral-mouthpiece <em>The Atlantic</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is somewhat ironic that the first serious strains 
caused by Europeâs changing demographics are showing up in the 
Continentâs welfare budgets, because the pension systems themselves may 
well have shaped, and limited, Europeâs growth. The 20th century saw 
international adoption of social-security systems that promised defined 
benefits paid out of future tax revenueâknown to pension experts as 
âpaygoâ systems, and to critics as Ponzi schemes. These systems have 
greatly eased fears of a destitute old age, but multiple studies show 
that as social-security systems become more generous (and old age more 
secure), people have fewer children. By one estimate, 50 to 60 percent 
of the difference between Americaâs (above-replacement) birthrate and 
Europeâs can be explained by the latterâs more generous systems. In 
other words, Europeâs pension system may have set in motion the very 
demographic decline that helped make that systemâand some European 
governmentsâinsolvent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite McArdleâs ridiculous suggestion that the United States of 
America has in some way exempted itself from Europeâs mortuary path, the
 broad outline of the diagnosis is clear, and increasingly accepted as 
commonsensical (although best ignored). According to the rising creed, 
welfare attained through progeny and savings is non-universal, and thus 
morally-benighted. It should be supplanted, as widely and rapidly as 
possible, by universal benefits or âpositive rightsâ distributed 
universally to the democratic citizen and thus, inevitably, routed 
through the altruistic State. If as a result, due to the irredeemable 
political incorrectness of reality, economies and populations should 
collapse in concert, at least it will not damage our souls. Oh 
democracy! You saccharine-sweet dying idiot, what do you think the 
zombie hordes will care for your soul?</p>

<blockquote><p>Universalism, in my opinion, is best described as a mystery cult of power.</p>
<p>Itâs a cult of power because one critical stage in its replicative 
lifecycle is a little critter called the State. When we look at the big 
Uâs surface proteins, we notice that most of them can be explained by 
its need to capture, retain, and maintain the State, and direct its 
powers toward the creation of conditions that favor the continued 
replication of Universalism. Itâs as hard to imagine Universalism 
without the State as malaria without the mosquito.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Itâs a mystery cult because it displaces theistic traditions by 
replacing metaphysical superstitions with philosophical mysteries, such 
as humanity, progress, equality, democracy, justice, environment, 
community, peace, etc.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
None of these concepts, as defined in orthodox Universalist doctrine, is
 even slightly coherent. All can absorb arbitrary mental energy without 
producing any rational thought. In this they are best compared to 
Plotinian, Talmudic, or Scholastic nonsense.</p></blockquote>

<p>Without a taste for irony, Mencius Moldbug is all but unendurable, 
and certainly unintelligible. Vast structures of historical irony shape 
his writings, at times even engulfing them. How otherwise could a 
proponent of traditional configurations of social order â a 
self-proclaimed Jacobite â compose a body of work that is stubbornly 
dedicated to subversion?</p>
<p>Irony is Moldbugâs method, as well as his milieu. This can be seen, 
most tellingly, in his chosen name for the usurped enlightenment, the 
dominant faith of the modern world: Universalism. This is a word that he
 appropriates (and capitalizes) within a reactionary diagnosis whose 
entire force lies in its exposure of an exorbitant particularity.</p>
<p>Moldbug turns continually to history (or, more rigorously, <em>cladistics</em>),
 to accurately specify that which asserts its own universal significance
 whilst ascending to a state of general dominance that approaches the 
universal. Under this examination, what counts as Universal reason, 
determining the direction and meaning of modernity, is revealed as the 
minutely determined branch or sub-species of a cultic tradition, 
descended from ârantersâ, âlevelersâ, and closely related variants of 
dissident, ultra-protestant fanaticism, and owing vanishingly little to 
the conclusions of logicians.</p>
<p>Ironically, then, the worldâs regnant <em>Universalist</em> democratic-egalitarian faith is a particular or peculiar cult that has <em>broken out</em>,
 along identifiable historical and geographical pathways, with an 
epidemic virulence that is disguised as progressive global 
enlightenment. The route that it has taken, through England and New 
England, Reformation and Revolution, is recorded by an accumulation of 
traits that provide abundant material for irony, and for lower varieties
 of comedy. The unmasking of the modern âliberalâ intellectual or 
âopen-mindedâ media âtruth-tellerâ as a pale, fervent, narrowly 
doctrinaire puritan, recognizably descended from the species of 
witch-burning zealots, is reliably â and irresistibly â entertaining.</p>
<p>Yet, as the Cathedral extends and tightens its grip upon everything, 
everywhere, in accordance with its divine mandate, the response it 
triggers is only atypically humorous. More commonly, when unable to 
exact humble compliance, it encounters inarticulate rage, or at least 
uncomprehending, smoldering resentment, as befits the imposition of 
parochial cultural dogmas, still wrapped in the trappings of a specific,
 alien pedigree, even as they earnestly confess to universal 
rationality.</p>
<p>Consider, for instance, the most famous words of Americaâs <em><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_transcript.html">Declaration of Independence</a></em>:
 âWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created 
equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable 
Rights â¦â Could it be honestly maintained that to submit, scrupulously 
and sincerely, to such âself-evidentâ truths amounts to anything other 
than an act of religious re-confirmation or conversion? Or denied that, 
in these words, reason and evidence are explicitly <em>set aside</em>, 
to make room for principles of faith? Could anything be less scientific 
than such a declaration, or more indifferent to the criteria of 
genuinely universal reasoning? How could anybody who was not <em>already a believer</em> be expected to consent to such assumptions?</p>
<p>That the founding statement of the democratic-republican creed should
 be formulated as a statement of pure (and doctrinally recognizable) 
faith is information of sorts, but it is not yet irony. The irony begins
 with the fact that among the elites of todayâs Cathedral, these words 
of the Declaration of Independence (as well as many others) would be 
found â almost universally â to be quaintly suggestive at best, perhaps 
vaguely embarrassing, and most certainly incapable of supporting literal
 assent. Even amongst libertarian-slanted conservatives, a firm 
commitment to ânatural rightsâ is unlikely to proceed confidently and 
emphatically to their divine origination. For modern âliberalsâ, 
believers in the rights-bestowing (or entitlement) State, such archaic 
ideas are not only absurdly dated, but positively obstructive. For that 
reason, they are associated less with revered predecessors than with the
 retarded, fundamentalist thinking of political enemies. Sophisticates 
of the Cathedral core understand, as Hegel did, that God is no more than
 deep government apprehended by infants, and as such a waste of faith 
(that bureaucrats could put to better use).</p>
<p>Since the Cathedral has ascended to global supremacy, it no longer 
has need for Founding Fathers, who awkwardly recall its parochial 
ancestry, and impede its transnational public relations. Rather, it 
seeks perpetual re-invigoration through their denigration. The 
phenomenon of the âNew Atheismâ, with its transparent progressive 
affiliations, attests abundantly to this. Paleo-puritanism must be 
derided in order for neo-puritanism to flourish â<em> the meme is dead, long live the meme</em>!</p>
<p>At the limit of self-parody, neo-puritan parricide takes the form of 
the ludicrous âWar on Christmasâ, in which the allies of the Cathedral 
sanctify the (radically unthreatened) separation of Church and State 
through nuisance agitation against public expressions of traditional 
Christian piety, and their âRed Stateâ dupes respond with dyspeptic 
outrage on cable TV shows. Like every other war against fuzzy nouns 
(whether âpovertyâ, âdrugsâ, or âterrorâ), the outcome is predictably 
perverse. If resistance to the War on Christmas is not yet established 
as the solid center of Yuletide festivities, it can be confidently 
expected to become so in the future. The purposes of the Cathedral are 
served nonetheless, through promotion of a synthetic secularism that 
separates the progressive faith from its religious foundations, whilst 
directing attention away from the ethnically specific, dogmatic creedal 
content at its core.</p>
<p>As reactionaries go, traditional Christians are generally considered 
to be quite cuddly. Even the most wild-eyed fanatics of the neo-puritan 
orthodoxy have trouble getting genuinely excited about them (although 
abortion activists get close). For some real red meat, with the nerves 
exposed and writhing to jolts of hard stimulation, it makes far more 
sense to turn to another discarded and ceremonially abominated block on 
the progressive lineage: White Identity Politics, or (the term Moldbug <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/11/why-i-am-not-white-nationalist.html">opts for</a>) âwhite nationalismâ.</p>
<p>Just as the ratchet progress of neo-puritan social democracy is 
radically facilitated by the orchestrated pillorying of its embryonic 
religious forms, so is its trend to consistently neo-fascist political 
economy smoothed by the concerted repudiation of a âneo-naziâ (or 
paleo-fascist) threat. It is extremely convenient, when constructing 
ever more nakedly corporatist or âthird positionâ structures of 
state-directed pseudo-capitalism, to be able to divert attention to 
angry expressions of white racial paranoia, especially when these are 
ornamented by clumsily modified nazi insignia, horned helmets, Leni 
Riefenstahl aesthetics, and slogans borrowed freely from <em>Mein Kampf</em>.
 In the United States (and thus, with shrinking time-lag, 
internationally) the icons of the Ku Klux Klan, from white bed-sheets, 
quasi-Masonic titles, and burning crosses, to lynching ropes, have 
acquired comparable theatrical value.</p>
<p>Moldbug offers a sanitized white nationalist blog reading list, 
consisting of writers who â to varying degrees of success â avoid 
immediate reversion to paleo-fascist self-parody. The first step beyond 
the boundary of respectable opinion is represented by <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://amnation.com/vfr/">Lawrence Auster</a>,
 a Christian, anti-Darwinist, and âTraditionalist Conservativeâ who 
defends âsubstantialâ (ethno-racial) national identity and opposes the 
liberal master-principle of nondiscrimination. By the time we reach â<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://age-of-treason.blogspot.com/">Tanstaafl</a>â,
 at the ripped outer edge of Moldbugâs carefully truncated spectrum, we 
have entered a decaying orbit, spiraling into the great black hole that 
is hidden at the dead center of modern political possibility.</p>
<p>Before following the Tanstaafl-types into the crushing abyss where 
light dies, there are some preliminary remarks to make about the white 
nationalist perspective, and its implications. Even more than the 
Christian traditionalists (who, even in their cultural mid-winter, can 
bask in the warmth of supernatural endorsement), white identity politics
 considers itself <em>besieged</em>. Moderate or measured concern offers
 no equilibrium for those who cross the line, and begin to self-identify
 in these terms. Instead, the path of involvement demands rapid 
acceleration to a state of extreme alarm, or racial panic, conforming to
 an analysis focused upon malicious population replacement at the hands 
of a government which, in the oft-cited words of Bertolt Brecht, âhas 
decided to dissolve the people, and to appoint another one.â âWhitenessâ
 (whether conceived biologically, mystically, or both) is associated 
with vulnerability, fragility, and persecution. This theme is so basic, 
and so multifarious, that it is difficult to adequately address 
succinctly. It encompasses everything from criminal predation 
(especially racially-charged murders, rapes, and beatings), economic 
exactions and inverse discrimination, cultural aggression by hostile 
academic and media systems, and ultimately âgenocideâ â or definitive 
racial destruction.</p>
<p>Typically, the prospective annihilation of the white race is 
attributed to its own systematic vulnerability, whether due to 
characteristic cultural traits (excessive altruism, susceptibility to 
moral manipulation, excessive hospitality, trust, universal reciprocity,
 guilt, or individualistic disdain for group identity), or more 
immediate biological factors (recessive genes supporting fragile Aryan 
phenotypes). Whilst it is unlikely that this sense of unique 
endangerment is reducible to the chromatic formula âWhite + Color = 
Colorâ, the fundamental structure is of this kind. In its abstract 
depiction of non-reciprocal vulnerability, it reflects the âone drop 
ruleâ (and Mendelian recessive / dominant gene combination). It depicts 
mixture as essentially anti-white.</p>
<p>Because âwhitenessâ is a limit (pure absence of color), it slips 
smoothly from the biological factuality of the Caucasian sub-species 
into metaphysical and mystical ideas. Rather than accumulating genetic 
variation, a white race is contaminated or polluted by admixtures that 
compromise its defining negativity â to darken it is to destroy it. The 
mythological density of these â predominantly subliminal â associations 
invests white identity politics with a resilience that frustrates 
enlightened efforts at rationalistic denunciation, whilst contradicting 
its own paranoid self-representation. It also undermines recent white 
nationalist promotions of a racial threat that is strictly comparable to
 that facing indigenous peoples, universally, and depicting whites as 
ânativesâ cruelly deprived of equal protection against extinction. There
 is no route back to tribal innocence, or flat, biological diversity. 
Whiteness has been compacted indissolubly with ideology, whichever the 
road taken.</p>
<p>âIf Blacks can have it, and Hispanics can have it, and Jews can have 
it, why canât we have it?â â Thatâs the final building block of white 
nationalist grievance, the werewolf curse that means it can only ever be
 a monster. Thereâs exactly one way out for persecuted palefaces, and it
 leads straight into a black hole. We promised to get back to Tanstaafl,
 and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://age-of-treason.blogspot.com/2007/09/committing-pcs-most-mortal-sin.html">here</a> we are, in late Summer 2007, shortly after he got â<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.theamericanconservative.com/article/2003/mar/10/00025/">the Jew thing</a>â. There isnât anything very original about his epiphany, which is exactly the point. He quotes himself:</p>
<blockquote><p>Isnât it absurd that anyone would even think to blame 
Christianity or WASPs for the rise of PC and its catastrophic 
consequences? Isnât this in fact a reversal of the truth? Hasnât the 
rise and spread of PC eroded the power of Christianity, WASPs, and 
whites in general? Blaming them is in effect blaming the victim.</p>
<p>Yes, there are Christians, WASPs, and whites who have fallen for the 
PC brainwashing. Yes, there are some who have taken it so deeply to 
heart that they work to expand and protect it. Thatâs the nature of PC. 
That is its purpose. To control the minds of the people it seeks to 
destroy. The left, at its root, is all about destruction.</p>
<p>You donât have to be an anti-Semite to notice where these ideas 
originate from and who benefits. But you do have to violate PC to say: 
Jews.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thatâs the labyrinth, the trap, with its pitifully constricted, 
stereotypical circuit. âWhy canât we be cuddly racial preservationists, 
like Amazonian Indians? How come we always turn into Neo-Nazis? Itâs 
some kind of conspiracy, which means <em>it has to be the Jews</em>.â 
Since the mid-20th century, the political intensity of the globalized 
world has streamed, almost exclusively, out of the cratered ash-pile of 
the Third Reich. Until you get the pattern, it seems mysterious that 
thereâs no getting away from it. After listing some blogs falling under 
the relatively genteel category of âwhite nationalismâ, Moldbug <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/11/why-i-am-not-white-nationalist.html">cautions</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Internet is also home to many out-and-out racist 
blogs. Most are simply unreadable. But some are hosted by relatively 
capable writers â¦ On these racist blogs youâll find racial epithets, 
anti-Semitism (see <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/06/why-i-am-not-anti-semite.html">why I am not an anti-Semite</a>)
 and the like. Obviously, I cannot recommend any of these blogs, and nor
 will I link to them. However, if you are interested in the mind of the 
modern racist, Google will get you there.</p></blockquote>
<p>Google is overkill. A little link-trawling will get you there. Itâs a
 âsix degrees of separationâ problem (and more like two, or less). Start
 digging into the actually existing âreactosphereâ, and things get quite
 astoundingly ugly very quickly. Yes, there really is âhateâ, panic, and
 disgust, as well as a morbidly addictive abundance of very grim, 
vitriolic wit, and a disconcertingly impressive weight of credible fact 
(these guys just <em>love</em> statistics to death). Most of all, just 
beyond the horizon, thereâs the black hole. If reaction ever became a 
popular movement, its few slender threads of bourgeois (or perhaps 
dreamily âaristocraticâ) civility wouldnât hold back the beast for long.</p>
<p>As liberal decency has severed itself from intellectual integrity, 
and exiled harsh truths, these truths have found new allies, and become 
considerably harsher. The outcome is mechanically, and monotonously, 
predictable. Every liberal democratic âcause warâ strengthens and 
feralizes what it fights. The war on poverty creates a chronically 
dysfunctional underclass. The war on drugs creates crystallized 
super-drugs and mega-mafias. Guess what? The war on political 
incorrectness creates data-empowered, web-coordinated, paranoid and 
poly-conspiratorial werewolves, superbly positioned to take advantage of
 liberal democracyâs impending rendezvous with ruinous reality, and to 
then play their part in the unleashing of unpleasantnesses that are 
scarcely imaginable (except by disturbing historical analogy). When a 
sane, pragmatic, and fact-based negotiation of human differences is <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/10/james-watson-tells-inconvenient-truth_296.php">forbidden by ideological fiat</a>, the alternative is not a reign of perpetual peace, but a festering of increasingly self-conscious and militantly defiant <em>thoughtcrime</em>,
 nourished by publicly unavowable realities, and energized by powerful, 
atavistic, and palpably dissident mythologies. Thatâs obvious, on the 
âNet.</p>
<p>Moldbug considers the danger of white nationalism to be both over- 
and understated. On the one hand, the âmenaceâ is simply ridiculous, and
 merely reflects neo-puritan spiritual dogma in its most hysterically 
oppressive and stubbornly mindless form. âIt should be obvious that, 
although I am not a white nationalist, I am not exactly allergic to the 
stuff,â Moldbug remarks, before describing it as âthe most marginalized 
and socially excluded belief system in the history of the world â¦ an 
obnoxious social irritant in any circle which does not include tattooed 
speedfreak bikers.â</p>
<p>Yet the danger remains, or rather, is <em>under construction</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>I can imagine one possibility which might make white 
nationalism genuinely dangerous. White nationalism would be dangerous if
 there was some issue on which white nationalists were right, and 
everyone else was wrong. Truth is always dangerous. Contrary to common 
belief, it does not always prevail. But itâs always a bad idea to turn 
your back on it. â¦While the evidence for human cognitive biodiversity is
 indeed debatable, whatâs not debatable is that it is debatable â¦[even 
though] everyone who is not a white nationalist has spent the last 50 
years informing us that it is not debatable â¦</p></blockquote>
<p>Thereâs far more to Moldbugâs essay, as there always is. Eventually 
it explains why he rejects white nationalism, on grounds that owe 
nothing to conventional reflexes. But the dark heart of the essay, 
lifting it beyond brilliance to the brink of genius, is found early on, 
at the edge of a black hole:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why does white nationalism strike us as evil? Because 
Hitler was a white nationalist, and Hitler was evil. Neither of these 
statements is remotely controvertible. There is exactly one degree of 
separation between white nationalism and evil. And that degree is 
Hitler. Let me repeat: Hitler.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The argument seems watertight. (Hitlertight?) But it holds no water at all.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Why does socialism strike us as evil? Because Stalin was a socialist, 
and Stalin was evil. Anyone who wants to seriously argue that Stalin was
 less evil than Hitler has an awful long row to hoe. Not only did Stalin
 order more murders, his murder machine had its heyday in peacetime, 
whereas Hitlerâs can at least be seen as a war crime against enemy 
civilians. Whether this makes a difference can be debated, but if it 
does it puts Stalin on top.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
And yet I have never had or seen anything like the âred flagsâ response 
to socialism [âthe sense of the presence of evilâ]. If I saw a crowd of 
young, fashionable people lining up at the box office for a hagiographic
 biopic on Reinhard Heydrich, chills would run up and down my neck. For 
Ernesto Guevara, I have no emotional response. Perhaps I think itâs 
stupid and sad. I do think itâs stupid and sad. But it doesnât freak me 
out.</p></blockquote>
<p>Any attempt to be nuanced, balanced, or proportional in the moral 
case against Hitler is to entirely misconstrue the nature of the 
phenomenon. This can be noted, quite regularly, in Asian societies, for 
instance, because the ghost of the Third Reich does not occupy central 
position in their history, or rather, their <em>religion</em>, although â
 as the inner sanctum of the Cathedral â it is determined to (and shows 
almost every sign of succeeding). A brief digression on cross-cultural 
misunderstanding and reciprocal blindness might be merited at this 
point. When Westerners pay attention to the âGod-Emperorâ style of 
political devotion that has accompanied modern totalitarianism in East 
Asia, the conclusion typically drawn is that this pattern of political 
feeling is exotically alien, morbidly amusing, and ultimately â 
chillingly â incomprehensible. Contemporary comparisons with laughably 
non-numinous Western democratic leaders only deepen the confusion, as do
 clumsy quasi-Marxist references to âfeudalâ sensibilities (as if 
absolute monarchy was not an <em>alternative</em> to feudalism, and as if absolute monarchs were worshipped). <em>How could a historical and political figure ever be invested with the transcendent dignity of absolute religious meaning?</em> It seems absurd â¦</p>
<p>âLook, Iâm not saying that Hitler was a particularly nice guy â¦â â to
 imagine such words is already to see many things. It might even provoke
 the question: Does anybody within the (Cathedralâs) globalized world 
still think that Adolf Hitler was less evil than the Prince of Darkness 
himself? Perhaps only a few scattered paleo-Christians (who stubbornly 
insist that Satan is really, <em>really</em> bad), and an even smaller 
number of Neo-Nazi ultras (who think Hitler was kind of cool). For 
pretty much everybody else, Hitler <em>perfectly</em> personifies 
demonic monstrosity, transcending history and politics to attain the 
stature of a metaphysical absolute: evil incarnate. Beyond Hitler it is 
impossible to go, or think. This is surely interesting, since it 
indicates an irruption of the infinite within history â a religious 
revelation, of inverted, yet structurally familiar, Abrahamic type. 
(âHolocaust Theologyâ already implies as much.)</p>
<p>In this regard, rather than Satan, it might be more helpful to 
compare Hitler to the Antichrist, which is to say: to a mirror Messiah, 
of reversed moral polarity. There was even an empty tomb. <em>Hitlerism</em>,
 neutrally conceived, therefore, is less a pro-Nazi ideology than a 
universal faith, speciated within the Abrahamic super-family, and united
 in acknowledging the coming of pure evil on earth. Whilst not exactly 
worshipped (outside the extraordinarily disreputable circles already 
ventured into), Hitler is sacramentally abhorred, in a way that touches 
upon theological âfirst thingsâ. If to embrace Hitler as God is a sign 
of highly lamentable politico-spiritual confusion (at best), to 
recognize his historical singularity and sacred meaning is 
near-mandatory, since he is affirmed by all men of sound faith as the 
exact complement of the incarnate God (the revealed anti-Messiah, or 
Adversary), and this identification has the force of âself-evident 
truthâ. (Did anybody ever need to ask why the <em>reductio ad Hitlerum</em> works?)</p>
<p>Conveniently, like the secularized neo-puritanism that it swallows, 
(aversive) Hitlerism can be safely taught in American schools, at a 
remarkably high level of religious intensity. Insofar as progressive or 
programmatic history continues, this suggests that the Church of Sacred 
Hitlerite Abomination will eventually supplant its Abrahamic 
predecessors, to become the worldâs triumphant ecumenical faith. How 
could it not? After all, unlike vanilla deism, this is a faith that 
fully reconciles religious enthusiasm with enlightened opinion, equally 
adapted, with consummate amphibious capability, to the convulsive 
ecstasies of popular ritual and the letter pages of the <em>New York Times</em>.
 âAbsolute evil once walked amongst us, and lives still â¦â How is this 
not, already, the principal religious message of our time? All that 
remains unfinished is the mythological consolidation, and that has long 
been underway.</p>

<p><em>My own sense of the thing is that underneath the happy talk, 
underneath the dogged adherence to failed ideas and dead theories, 
underneath the shrieking and anathematizing at people like me, there is a
 deep and cold despair. In our innermost hearts, we donât believe racial
 harmony can be attained. Hence the trend to separation. We just want to
 get on with our lives away from each other. Yet for a moralistic, 
optimistic people like Americans, this despair is unbearable. Itâs 
pushed away somewhere we donât have to think about it. When someone 
forces us to think about it, we react with fury. That little boy in the

<p>There is no part of Singapore, Hong Kong, Taipei, Shanghai, or very 
many other East Asian cities where it is impossible to wander, safely, 
late at night. Women, whether young or old, on their own or with small 
children, can be comfortably oblivious to the details of space and time,
 at least insofar as the threat of assault is concerned. Whilst this 
might not be quite sufficient to define a civilized society, it comes 
extremely close. It is certainly <em>necessary</em> to any such definition. The contrary case is barbarism.</p>
<p>These lucky cities of the western Pacific Rim are typified by 
geographical locations and demographic profiles that conspicuously echo 
the embarrassingly well-behaved âmodel minoritiesâ of Occidental 
countries. They are (non-obnoxiously) dominated by populations that â 
due to biological heredity, deep cultural traditions, or some 
inextricable entanglement of the two â find polite, prudent, and pacific
 social interactions comparatively effortless, and worthy of continuous 
reinforcement. They are also, importantly, open, cosmopolitan societies,
 remarkably devoid of chauvinistic boorishness or paranoid 
ethno-nationalist sentiment. Their citizens are disinclined to emphasize
 their own virtues. On the contrary, they will typically be modest about
 their individual and collective attributes and achievements, abnormally
 sensitive to their failures and shortcomings, and constantly alert to 
opportunities for improvement. Complacency is almost as rare as 
delinquency. In these cities an entire â and massively consequential â 
dimension of social terror is simply absent.</p>
<p>In much of the Western world, in stark contrast, barbarism has been 
normalized. It is considered simply obvious that cities have âbad areasâ
 that are not merely impoverished, but lethally menacing to outsiders 
and residents alike. Visitors are warned to stay away, whilst locals do 
their best to transform their homes into fortresses, avoid venturing 
onto the streets after dark, and â especially if young and male â turn 
to criminal gangs for protection, which further degrades the security of
 everybody else. Predators control public space, parks are death traps, 
aggressive menace is celebrated as âattitudeâ, property acquisition is 
for mugs (or muggers), educational aspiration is ridiculed, and 
non-criminal business activity is despised as a violation of cultural 
norms. Every significant mechanism of socio-cultural pressure, from 
interpreted heritage and peer influences to political rhetoric and 
economic incentives, is aligned to the deepening of complacent depravity
 and the ruthless extirpation of every impulse to self-improvement. 
Quite clearly, these are places where civilization has fundamentally 
collapsed, and a society that includes them has to some substantial 
extent <em>failed</em>.</p>
<p>Within the most influential countries of the English-speaking world, 
the disintegration of urban civilization has profoundly shaped the 
structure and development of cities. In many cases, the ânaturalâ (one 
might now say âAsianâ) pattern, in which intensive urbanization and 
corresponding real estate values are greatest in the downtown core, has 
been shattered, or at least deeply deformed. Social disintegration of 
the urban center has driven an exodus of the (even moderately) 
prosperous to suburban and exurban refuges, producing a grotesque and 
historically unprecedented pattern of âdonutâ-style development, with 
cities tolerating â or merely accommodating themselves to â ruined and 
rotting interiors, where sane people fear to tread. âInner cityâ has 
come to mean almost exactly the opposite of what an undistorted course 
of urban development would produce. This is the geographical expression 
of a Western â and especially American â social problem that is at once 
basically unmentionable and visible from outer space.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the core-crashed donut syndrome has a notably 
insensitive yet commonly accepted name, which captures it in broad 
outlines â at least according to its secondary characteristics â and to a
 reasonable degree of statistical approximation: <em>White Flight</em>. This is an arresting term, for a variety of reasons. It is stamped, first of all, by the racial bi-polarity that â as a <em>vital archaism</em>
 â resonates with Americaâs chronic social crisis at a number of levels.
 Whilst superficially outdated in an age of many-hued multicultural and 
immigration issues, it reverts to the undead code inherited from slavery
 and segregation, perpetually identified with Faulknerâs words: âThe 
past is not dead. It isnât even past.â Yet even in this untypical moment
 of racial candor, blackness is elided, and implicitly disconnected from
 agency. It is denoted only by allusion, as a residue, concentrated 
passively and derivatively by the sifting function of a 
highly-adrenalized white panic. What <em>cannot be said</em> is 
indicated even as it is unmentioned. A distinctive silence accompanies 
the broken, half-expression of a mute tide of racial separatism, driven 
by civilizationally disabling terrors and animosities, whose depths, and
 structures of reciprocity, remain unavowable.</p>
<p>What the puritan exodus from Old to New World was to the foundation 
of Anglophone global modernity, white flight is to its fraying and 
dissolution. As with the pre-founding migration, what gives white flight
 ineluctable relevance here is its sub-political character: <em>all exit and no voice</em>.
 It is the subtle, non-argumentative, non-demanding âotherâ of social 
democracy and its dreams â the spontaneous impulse of dark 
enlightenment, as it is initially glimpsed, at once disillusioning and 
implacable.</p>
<p>The core-crashed donut is not the only model of sick city syndrome (the shanty fringe phenomenon emphasized in Mike Davisâ <em><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.amazon.com/Planet-Slums-Mike-Davis/dp/1844670228">Planet of Slums</a></em>
 is very different). Nor is donut-disaster urbanism reducible to racial 
crisis, at least in its origins. Technological factors have played a 
crucial role (most prominently, automobile geography) as have quite 
other, long-standing cultural traditions (such as the construction of 
suburbia as a bourgeois idyll). Yet all such lineages have been in very 
large measure supplanted by, or at least subordinated to, the inherited,
 and still emerging, ârace problem.â</p>
<p>So what is this âproblemâ? How is it developing? Why should anybody 
outside America be concerned about it? Why raise the topic now (if 
ever)? â If your heart is sinking under the gloomy suspicion this is 
going to be huge, meandering, nerve-wracking, and torturous, youâre 
right. Weâve got <em>weeks</em> in this chamber of horrors to look forward to.</p>
<p>The two simplest, quite widely held, and basically incompatible 
answers to the first question deserve to be considered as important <em>parts</em> of the problem.</p>
<p>Question: What is Americaâs race problem?</p>
<p>Answer-1: Black people.</p>
<p>Answer-2: White people.</p>
<p>The combined popularity of these options is significantly expanded, 
most probably to encompass a large majority of all Americans, when is 
taken to include those who assume that one of these two answers 
dominates the thinking of the <em>other side</em>. Between them, the 
propositions âThe problem would be over if we could just rid ourselves 
of black hoodlums / white racistsâ and / or âThey think weâre all 
hoodlums / racists and want to get rid of usâ consume an impressive 
proportion of the political spectrum, establishing a solid foundation of
 reciprocal terror and aversion. When defensive projections are added 
(âWeâre not hoodlums, youâre racistsâ or âWeâre not racists, youâre 
hoodlumsâ), the potential for super-heated, non-synthesizing dialectics 
approaches the infinite.</p>
<p>Not that these âsidesâ are racial (except in black or white <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/11/why-i-am-not-white-nationalist.html">tribal-nationalist fantasy</a>).
 For crude stereotypes, it is far more useful to turn to the principal 
political dimension, and its categories of âliberalâ and âconservativeâ 
in the contemporary, American sense. To identify Americaâs race problem 
with white racism is the stereotypical <em>liberal</em> position, whilst identifying it with black social dysfunction is the exact <em>conservative</em> complement. Although these stances are formally symmetrical, it is their actual political <em>asymmetry</em> that charges the American race problem with its extraordinary historical dynamism and universal significance.</p>
<p>That American whites and blacks â considered crudely as statistical 
aggregates â co-exist in a relation of reciprocal fear and perceived 
victimization, is attested by the manifest patterns of urban development
 and navigation, school choice, gun ownership, policing and 
incarceration, and just about every other expression of <em>revealed</em> (as opposed to <em>stated</em>)
 preference that is related to voluntary social distribution and 
security. An objective balance of terror reigns, erased from visibility 
by complementary yet incompatible perspectives of victimological 
supremacism and denial. Yet between <em>the liberal and conservative positions on race</em>
 there is no balance whatsoever, but something closer to a rout. 
Conservatives are utterly terrified of the issue, whilst for liberals it
 is a garden of earthly delight, whose pleasures transcend the limits of
 human understanding. When any political discussion firmly and clearly 
arrives at the topic of race, liberalism wins. That is the fundamental 
law of ideological effectiveness in the <del>shadow</del> fragrant shade
 of the Cathedral. In certain respects, this dynamic political imbalance
 is even the primary phenomenon under consideration (and much more needs
 to be said about it, down the road).</p>
<p>The regular, excruciating, soul-crushing humiliation of conservatism 
on the race issue should come as no surprise to anybody. After all, the 
principal role of conservatism in modern politics is to be humiliated. 
That is what a perpetual loyal opposition, or court jester, is for. The 
essential character of liberalism, as guardian and proponent of 
neo-puritan spiritual truth, invests it with supreme mastery over the 
dialectic, or invulnerability to contradiction. <em>That which it is impossible to think must necessarily be embraced through faith.</em>
 Consider only the fundamental doctrine or first article of the liberal 
creed, as promulgated through every public discussion, academic 
articulation, and legislative initiative relevant to the topic: <em>Race doesnât exist, except as a social construct employed by one race to exploit and oppress another.</em>
 Merely to entertain it is to shudder before the awesome majesty of the 
absolute, where everything is simultaneously its precise opposite, and 
reason evaporates ecstatically at the brink of the sublime.</p>
<p>If the world was built out of ideology, this story would already be 
over, or at least predictably programmed. Beyond the apparent zig-zag of
 the dialectic there is a dominant trend, heading in a single, 
unambiguous direction. Yet the liberal-progressive solution to the race 
problem â open-endedly escalating, comprehensively systematic, 
dynamically paradoxical âanti-racismâ â confronts a real obstacle that 
is only very partially reflected in conservative attitudes, rhetoric, 
and ideology. The real enemy, glacial, inchoate, and non-argumentative, 
is âwhite flightâ.</p>
<p>At this point, explicit reference to the Derbyshire Case becomes 
irresistible. There is a very considerable amount of complex, recent 
historical context that cries out for introduction â the cultural 
convulsion attending the Trayvon Martin incident in particular â but 
thereâll be time for that later (oh yes, Iâm afraid so). Derbyshireâs 
intervention, and the explosion of words it provoked, while to some 
extent illuminated by such context, far exceeds it. That is because the 
crucial unspoken term, both in Derbyshireâs now-notorious <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://takimag.com/article/the_talk_nonblack_version_john_derbyshire">short article</a>,
 and also â apparently â in the responses it generated, is âwhite 
flightâ. By publishing paternal advice to his (Eurasian) children that 
has been â not entirely unreasonably â summarized as âavoid black 
peopleâ, he converted white flight from a much-lamented but seemingly 
inexorable fact into an explicit imperative, even a <em>cause. Donât argue, flee.</em></p>
<p>The word Derbyshire emphasizes, in his own penumbra of commentary, and in antecedent writings, is not âflightâ or âpanicâ, but <em>despair</em>.
 When asked by blogger Vox Day whether he agreed that the ârace cardâ 
had become less intimidating over the past two decades, Derbyshire <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://voxday.blogspot.com/2012/04/derbyshire.html">replies</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>One [factor], which Iâve written about more than once, I 
think, in the United States, is just despair. I am of a certain age, and
 I was around 50 years ago. I was reading the newspapers and following 
world events and I remember the civil rights movement. I was in England,
 but we followed it. I remember it, I remember what we felt about it, 
and what people were writing about it. It was full of hope. The idea in 
everyoneâs mind was that if we strike down these unjust laws and we 
outlaw all this discrimination, then weâll be whole. Then America will 
be made whole. After an intermediate period of a few years, who knows, 
maybe 20 years, with a hand up from things like affirmative action, 
black America will just merge into the general population and the whole 
thing will just go away. Thatâs what everybody believed. Everybody 
thought that. And it didnât happen.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Here we are, weâre 50 years later, and weâve still got these tremendous 
disparities in crime rates, educational attainment, and so on. And I 
think, although theyâre still mouthing the platitudes, Americans in 
their hearts feel a kind of cold despair about it. They feel that Thomas
 Jefferson was probably right and we canât live together in harmony. I 
think thatâs why you see this slow ethnic disaggregation. We have a very
 segregated school system now. There are schools within 10 miles of 
where Iâm sitting that are 98 percent minority. In residential housing 
too, itâs the same thing. So I think there is a cold, dark despair 
lurking in Americaâs collective heart about the whole thing.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a version of reality that few want to hear. As Derbyshire 
recognizes, Americans are a predominantly Christian, optimistic, 
âcan-doâ people, whose âcollective heartâ is unusually maladapted to an <em>abandonment of hope</em>. This is a country culturally hard-wired to interpret despair not merely as error or weakness, but as <em>sin</em>.
 Nobody who understands this could be remotely surprised to find bleak 
hereditarian fatalism being rejected â typically with vehement hostility
 â not only by progressives, but also by the overwhelming majority of 
conservatives. At NRO, Andrew C. McCarthy no doubt spoke for many in 
remarking:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is a world of difference, though, between the need 
to be able to discuss uncomfortable facts about IQ and incarceration, on
 the one hand, and, on the other, to urge race as a rationale for 
abandoning basic Christian charity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Others went much further. At the Examiner, James Gibson <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.examiner.com/faith-culture-in-columbia/john-derbyshire-and-the-danger-of-conservatism-divorced-from-christianity">seized</a>
 upon âJohn Derbyshireâs vile racist screedâ as the opportunity to teach
 a wider lesson â âthe danger of conservatism divorced from 
Christianityâ:</p>
<blockquote><p>â¦ since Derbyshire does not believe âthat Jesus of 
Nazareth was divine â¦ and that the Resurrection was a real event,â he 
cannot comprehend the great mystery of the Incarnation, whereby the 
Divine truly did take on human flesh in the person of Jesus of Nazareth 
and suffered death at the hands of a fallen humanity in order to redeem 
that humanity out of its state of fallenness.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Herein lies the danger of a conservative socio-political philosophy 
divorced from a robust Christian faith. It becomes a dead ideology 
spawning a view of humanity that is toxic, fatalistic, and (as 
Derbyshire proves abundantly) uncharitable.</p></blockquote>
<p>It was, of course, on the left that the fireworks truly ignited. Elspeth Reeve at the Atlantic Wire <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2012/04/why-john-derbyshire-hasnt-been-fired-yet/50803/">contended</a>
 that Derbyshire had clung on to his relation with the National Review 
because he was offering the magazineâs âless enlightened readersâ what 
they wanted: âdated racial stereotypes.â Like Gibson on the right, she 
was keen for people to learn a wider lesson: donât think for a minute 
this stops with Derbyshire. (The stunningly uncooperative comments 
thread to her article is worth noting.)</p>
<p>At Gawker, Louis Peitzman <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://gawker.com/5900109/racist-john-derbyshire-fired-for-writing-most-racist-article-possible">jumped the shark</a>
 (in the approved direction) by describing Derbyshireâs âhorrifying 
diatribeâ as the âmost racist article possible,â a judgment that betrays
 extreme historical ignorance, a sheltered life, unusual innocence, and a
 lack of imagination, as well as making the piece sound far more 
interesting than it actually is. Peitzmanâs commentators are impeccably 
liberal, and of course uniformly, utterly, shatteringly appalled (to the
 point of orgasm). Beyond the emoting, Peitzman doesnât offer much 
content, excepting only a little extra emoting â this time mild 
satisfaction mixed with residual rage â at the news that Derbyshireâs 
punishment has at least begun (âa step in the right directionâ) with his
 âcanningâ from the <em>National Review</em>.</p>
<p>Joanna Schroeder (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://goodmenproject.com/good-feed-blog/racist-writings-should-derbyshire-and-weigel-be-fired/">writing</a>
 at something called the Good Feed Blog) sought to extend the purge 
beyond Derbyshire, to include anybody who had not yet erupted into 
sufficiently melodramatic paroxysms of indignation, starting with <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2012/04/06/john_derbyshire_s_advice_for_white_people.html">David Weigel at Slate</a>
 (who she doesnât know âin real life, but in reading this piece, it 
seems you just might be a racist, palâ). âThere are so many â¦ racist, 
dehumanizing references to black people in Derbyshireâs article that I 
have to just stop myself here before I recount the entire thing point by
 point with fuming rage,â she shares. Unlike Peitzman, however, at least
 Schroeder has a point â the racial terror dialectic â ââ¦ propagating 
the idea that we should be afraid of black men, of black people in 
general, makes this world dangerous for innocent Americans.â <em>Your fear makes you scary</em> (although apparently not with legitimate reciprocity).</p>
<p>As for Weigel, he gets the terror good and hard. Within hours heâs <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2012/04/07/derbyshire_again.html">back</a>
 at the keyboard, apologizing for his previous insouciance, and for the 
fact he ânever ended up saying the obvious: People, the essay was 
disgusting.â</p>
<p>So what did Derbyshire actually say, where did it come from, and what
 does it mean to American politics (and beyond)? This sub-series will 
comb through the spectrum from left to right in search of suggestions, 
with socio-geographically manifested âwhiteâ panic / despair as a 
guiding thread â¦</p>

<p>âI donât want to scare him or have him paint people with a broad

<p>âIn brief, dialectics can be defined as the doctrine of the unity of opposites. This embodies the essence of dialectics,â Lenin <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/summary.htm">notes</a>, âbut it requires explanations and development.â That is to say: further discussion.</p>
<p>The sublimation (<em>Aufhebung</em>) of Marxism into Leninism is an 
eventuality that is best grasped crudely. By forging a revolutionary 
communist politics of broad application, almost entirely divorced from 
the mature material conditions or advanced social contradictions that 
had been previously anticipated, Lenin demonstrated that dialectical 
tension coincided, exhaustively, with its politicization (and that all 
reference to a âdialectics of natureâ is no more than retrospective 
subordination of the scientific domain to a political model). Dialectics
 are as real as they are made to be.</p>
<p>The dialectic begins with political agitation, and extends no further
 than its practical, antagonistic, factional and coalitional âlogicâ. It
 is the âsuperstructureâ <em>for itself</em>, or against natural 
limitation, practically appropriating the political sphere in its 
broadest graspable extension as a platform for social domination. 
Everywhere that there is argument, there is an unresolved opportunity to
 rule.</p>
<p>The Cathedral incarnates these lessons. It has no need to espouse 
Leninism, or operational communist dialectics, because it recognizes 
nothing else. There is scarcely a fragment of the social 
âsuperstructureâ that has escaped dialectical reconstruction, through 
articulate antagonism, polarization, binary structuring, and reversal. 
Within the academy, the media, even the fine arts, political 
super-saturation has prevailed, identifying even the most minuscule 
elements of apprehension with conflictual âsocial critiqueâ and 
egalitarian teleology. Communism is the universal implication.</p>
<p>More dialectics is more politics, and more politics means âprogressâ â
 or social migration to the left. The production of public agreement 
only leads in one direction, and within public disagreement, such 
impetus already exists in embryo. It is only in the absence of agreement
 <em>and</em> of publicly articulated disagreement, which is to say, in 
non-dialectics, non-argument, sub-political diversity, or politically 
uncoordinated initiative, that the âright-wingâ refuge of âthe economyâ 
(and civil society more widely) is to be found.</p>
<p>When no agreement is necessary, or coercively demanded, negative (or 
âlibertarianâ) liberty is still possible, and this non-argumentative 
âotherâ of dialectics is easily formulated (even if, in a free society, 
it doesnât need to be): <em>Do your own thing</em>. Quite clearly, this irresponsible and negligent imperative is <em>politically</em>
 intolerable. It coincides exactly with leftist depression, 
retrogression, or depoliticization. Nothing cries out more urgently to 
be <em>argued against</em>.</p>
<p>At the opposite extreme lies the dialectical ecstasy of theatrical 
justice, in which the argumentative structure of legal proceedings is 
coupled with publicization through the media. Dialectical enthusiasm 
finds its definitive expression in a courtroom drama that combines 
lawyers, journalists, community activists, and other agents of the 
revolutionary superstructure in the production of a show trial. Social 
contradictions are staged, antagonistic cases articulated, and 
resolution institutionally expected. This is Hegel for prime-time 
television (and now for the Internet). It is the way that the Cathedral 
shares its message with the people.</p>
<p>Sometimes, in its impatient passion for progress, this message can 
trip over itself, because even though the agents of the Cathedral are <em>infinitely</em>
 reasonable, they are ever less sensible, often strikingly incompetent, 
and prone to making mistakes. This is to be expected on theological 
grounds. As the state becomes God, it degenerates into imbecility, on 
the model of the holy fool. The media-politics of the Trayvon Martin 
spectacle provides a pertinent example.</p>
<p>In the United States, as in any other large country, lots of things 
happen every day, exhibiting innumerable patterns of varying obscurity. 
For <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm">instance</a>,
 on an average day, there are roughly 3,400 violent crimes, including 40
 murders, 230 rapes, 1,000 robberies, and 2,100 aggravated assaults, 
alongside 25,000 non-violent property crimes (burglaries and thefts). 
Very few of these will be widely publicized, or seized upon as 
educational, exemplary, and representative. Even were the media not 
inclined towards a narrative-based selection of âgood storiesâ, the 
sheer volume of incidents would compel something of the kind. Given this
 situation, it is all but inevitable that people will ask: <em>Why are they telling us this?</em></p>
<p>Almost everything about the death of Trayvon Martin is controversial,
 except for media motivation. On that topic there is near unanimity. The
 meaning or intended message of the story of the case could scarcely 
have been more transparent: <em>White racist paranoia makes America dangerous for black people.</em> It would thus rehearse the dialectic of racial terror (<em>your fear is scary</em>),
 designed â as always â to convert Americaâs reciprocal social nightmare
 into a unilateral morality play, allocating legitimate dread 
exclusively to one side of the countryâs principal racial divide. It 
seemed perfect. A malignantly deluded white vigilante guns down an 
innocent black child, justifying black fear (âthe talkâ) whilst exposing
 white panic as a murderous psychosis. This is a story of such 
archetypal progressive meaning that it cannot be told too many times. In
 fact, it was just too good to be true.</p>
<p>It soon became evident, however, that media selection â even when 
reinforced by the celebrity / âcommunity activistâ rage-machine â hadnât
 sufficed to keep the story on script, and both of the main actors were 
drifting from their assigned roles. If progressively-endorsed 
stereotypes were to be even remotely preserved, vigorous <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://destructure.wordpress.com/2012/03/20/trayvon-martin-faq/">editing</a> would be required. This was especially necessary because certain evil, racist, bigoted readers of the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/03/26/v-fullstory/2714778/thousands-expected-at-trayvon.html">Miami Herald</a> were beginning to forge a narrative-wrecking mental connection between âTrayvon Martinâ and âburglary toolâ.</p>
<p>As for the killer, George Zimmerman, the name said it all. He was 
clearly going to be a hulking, pasty-faced, storm-trooper look-alike, 
hopefully some kind of Christian gun-nut, and maybe â if they really hit
 pay-dirt â a militia movement type with a history of homophobia and 
anti-abortion activism. He started off âwhiteâ â for no obvious reason 
beyond media incompetence and narrative programming â then found himself
 transformed into a âwhite Hispanicâ (a category that seems to have been
 rapidly innovated on the spot), before gradually shifted through a 
series of ever more reality-compliant ethnic complications, culminating 
in the discovery of his Afro-Peruvian great grandfather.</p>
<p>In the heart of the Cathedral it was well into head-scratching time. 
Here was the great Amerikkkan defendant being prepped for his show 
trial, the President had pitched in emotionally on behalf of the sacred 
victim, and the coordinated ground game had been advanced to the 
simmering brink of race riots, when the message began falling apart, to 
such an extent that it now threatened to decay into an annoyingly 
irrelevant case of black-on-black violence. It was not only that George 
Zimmerman had black ancestry â making him simply âblackâ by the leftâs 
own social constructivist standards â he had also grown up amicably 
among black people, with two African-American girls as âpart of the 
household for years,â had entered into joint business venture with a 
black partner, he was a registered Democrat, and even some kind of 
âcommunity organizerâ â¦</p>
<p>So why did Martin die? Was it for carrying iced tea and a bag of 
Skittles while black (the media and community activist approved, âson 
Obama might have hadâ version), for scoping out burglary targets (the 
Kluxer racial profiling version), or for breaking Zimmermanâs nose, 
knocking him over, sitting on top of him, and smashing his head 
repeatedly against the sidewalk (to be decided in court)? Was he a 
martyr to racial injustice, a low-level social predator, or a human 
symptom of American urban crisis? The only thing that was really clear 
when legal proceedings began, beyond the squalid sadness of the episode,
 was that it was not resolving anything.</p>
<p>For a sense of just how disconcertingly the approved lesson had 
disintegrated by the time Zimmerman was charged with second degree 
murder, it is only necessary to read <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://onestdv.blogspot.com/2012/04/american-masses-and-why-i-stand-with.html">this post</a> by HBD-blogger oneSTDV, describing the dialectical derangements of the race-warrior right:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite the disturbing nature of the âchargesâ against 
Zimmerman, many in the alt-right refuse to grant Zimmerman any sympathy 
or to even view this as a seminal moment in modern leftismâs 
anarcho-tyrannical reign. According to these individuals, <strong>the Spanish-speaking, registered Democrat mestizo got what was coming to him</strong>
 â the ire of the black mob and the elite left indirectly buttressed by 
Zimmerman himself. Due to his voting record, multicultural background, 
and mentoring of minority youth, they see Zimmerman as emblematic of the
 leftâs assault on white America, a sort of ground soldier in the 
campaign against American whiteness.[Bolding in original]</p></blockquote>
<p>The pop PC police were ready to move on. With the great show trial 
collapsing into narrative disorder, it was time to refocus on the 
Message, facts be damned (and double damned). â<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://jezebel.com/5905291/a-complete-guide-to-hipster-racism">Jezebel</a>â best exemplifies the hectoring, vaguely hysterical tone:</p>
<blockquote><p>You know how you can tell that black people are still oppressed? Because <em>black people are still oppressed</em>.
 If you claim that you are not a racist person (or, at least, that 
youâre committed to working your ass off not to be one â which is really
 the best that any of us can promise), then you must believe that people
 are fundamentally born equal. So if thatâs true, then in a vacuum, 
factors like skin color should have no effect on anyoneâs success. 
Right? And therefore, if you really believe that all people are created 
equal, then when you see that drastic racial inequalities exist in the 
real world, the only thing that you could <em>possibly</em> conclude is 
that some external force is holding certain people back. Likeâ¦racism. 
Right? So congratulations! You believe in racism! Unless you donât 
actually think that people are born equal. And if you donât believe that
 people are born equal, <em>then youâre a f*****g racist</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Does anyone âreally believe that people are born equal,â in the way 
it is understood here? Believe, that is, not only that a formal 
expectation of equal treatment is a prerequisite for civilized 
interaction, but that any revealed deviation from substantial equality 
of outcome is an obvious, unambiguous indication of oppression? Thatâs 
âthe only thing you could <em>possibly</em> concludeâ?</p>
<p>At the very least, Jezebel should be congratulated for expressing the
 progressive faith in its purest form, entirely uncontaminated by 
sensitivity to evidence or uncertainty of any kind, casually 
contemptuous of any relevant research â whether existent or merely 
conceivable â and supremely confident about its own moral invincibility.
 If the facts are <em>morally wrong</em>, so much worse for the facts â thatâs the only position that could <em>possibly</em> be adopted, even if itâs based upon a mixture of wishful thinking, deliberate ignorance, and insultingly childish lies.</p>
<p>To call the belief in substantial human equality a superstition is to
 insult superstition. It might be unwarranted to believe in leprechauns,
 but at least the person who holds to such a belief isnât <em>watching them not exist</em>,
 for every waking hour of the day. Human inequality, in contrast, and in
 all of its abundant multiplicity, is constantly on display, as people 
exhibit their variations in gender, ethnicity, physical attractiveness, 
size and shape, strength, health, agility, charm, humor, wit, 
industriousness, and sociability, among countless other features, 
traits, abilities, and aspects of their personality, some immediately 
and conspicuously, some only slowly, over time. To absorb even the 
slightest fraction of all this and to conclude, in the only way 
possible, that it is either nothing at all, or a âsocial constructâ and 
index of oppression, is sheer Gnostic delirium: a commitment beyond all 
evidence to the existence of a true and good world veiled by 
appearances. People are not equal, they do not develop equally, their 
goals and achievements are not equal, and nothing can make them equal. 
Substantial equality has no relation to reality, except as its 
systematic negation. Violence on a genocidal scale is required to even 
approximate to a practical egalitarian program, and if anything less 
ambitious is attempted, people get around it (some more competently than
 others).</p>
<p>To take only the most obvious example, anybody with more than one child knows that <em>nobody is born equal</em> (monozygotic twins and clones perhaps excepted). <em>In fact</em>,
 everybody is born different, in innumerable ways. Even when â as is 
normally the case â the implications of these differences for life 
outcomes are difficult to confidently predict, their existence is 
undeniable, or at least: sincerely undeniable. Of course sincerity, or 
even minimal cognitive coherence, is not remotely the issue here. 
Jezebelâs position, whilst impeccable in its political correctness, is 
not only factually dubious, but rather laughably absurd, and actually â 
strictly speaking â insane. It dogmatizes a denial of reality so extreme
 that nobody could genuinely maintain, or even entertain it, let alone 
plausible explain or defend it. It is a tenet of faith that cannot be 
understood, but only asserted, or submitted to, as madness made law, or 
authoritarian religion.</p>
<p>The political commandment of this religion is transparent: Accept progressive social policy as the <em>only possible</em> solution to the <del>sin</del>
 problem of inequality. This commandment is a âcategorical imperativeâ â
 no possible fact could ever undermine, complicate, or revise it. If 
progressive social policy actually results in an exacerbation of the 
problem, âfallenâ reality is to blame, since the social malady is <em>obviously</em>
 worse than had been originally envisaged, and only redoubled efforts in
 the same direction can hope to remedy it. There can be nothing to learn
 in matters of faith. Eventually, systematic social collapse teaches the
 lesson that chronic failure and incremental deterioration could not 
communicate. (Thatâs macro-scale social Darwinism for dummies, and itâs 
the way that civilizations end.)</p>
<p>Due to itâs exceptional correlation with substantial variation in 
social outcomes in modern societies, by far the most troublesome 
dimension of human bio-diversity is intelligence or general problem 
solving ability, quantified as IQ (measuring Spearmanâs âgâ). When 
âstatistical common senseâ or profiling is applied to the proponents of 
Human Bio-Diversity, however, another significant trait is rapidly 
exposed: a remarkably consistent deficit of <em>agreeableness</em>. 
Indeed, it is widely accepted within the accursed âcommunityâ itself 
that most of those stubborn and awkward enough to educate themselves on 
the topic of human biological variation are significantly â<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/04/one-baby-alone-on-a-pca-island/#more-16427">socially retarded</a>â,
 with low verbal inhibition, low empathy, and low social integration, 
resulting in chronic maladaptation to group expectations. The typical 
EQs of this group can be extracted as the approximate square-root of 
their IQs. Mild autism is typical, sufficient to approach their fellow 
beings in a spirit of detached, natural-scientific curiosity, but not so
 advanced as to compel total cosmic disengagement. These traits, which 
they themselves consider â on the basis of copious technical information
 â to be substantially heritable, have manifest social consequences, 
reducing employment opportunities, incomes, and even reproductive 
potential. Despite all the free therapeutic advice available in the 
progressive environment, this obnoxiousness shows no sign of 
diminishing, and might even be intensifying. As Jezebel shows so 
clearly, this can only <em>possibly</em> be a sign of structural oppression. Why canât obnoxious people get a break?</p>
<p>The history is damning. âSociablesâ have always had it in for the 
obnoxious, often declining to marry or do business with them, excluding 
them from group activities and political office, labeling them with 
slurs, ostracizing and avoiding them. âObnoxiousnessâ has been 
stigmatized and stereotyped in extremely negative terms, to such an 
extent that many of the obnoxious have sought out more sensitive labels,
 such as âsocially-challengedâ, or âdifferently socially abledâ. Not 
uncommonly, people have been verbally or even physically assaulted for 
no other reason than their radical obnoxiousness. Most tragically of 
all, due to their complete inability to get on with one another, the 
obnoxious have never been able to politically mobilize against the 
structural social oppression they face, or to enter into coalitions with
 their natural allies, such as cynics, debunkers, contrarians, and 
Tourette Syndrome sufferers. Obnoxiousness has yet to be liberated, 
although itâs probable that the Internet will âhelpâ â¦</p>
<p>Consider John Derbyshireâs essay in infamy <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://takimag.com/article/the_talk_nonblack_version_john_derbyshire/print">The Talk: Nonblack Version</a>,
 focusing initially on its relentless obnoxiousness, and attentive to 
the negative correlation between sociability and objective reason. As 
Derbyshire notes elsewhere, people are generally incapable of 
differentiating themselves from group identities, or properly applying 
statistical generalizations about groups to individual cases, including 
their own. A rationally indefensible, but socially inevitable, 
reification of group profiles is psychologically normal â even âhumanâ â
 with the result that noisy, non-specific, statistical information is 
erroneously accepted as a contribution to self-understanding, even when 
specific information is available.</p>
<p>From the perspective of socially autistic, low-EQ, rational analysis, this is simply <em>mistaken</em>.
 If an individual has certain characteristics, the fact of belonging to a
 group that has similar or dissimilar average characteristics is of no 
relevance whatsoever. Direct and determinate information about the 
individual is not to any degree enriched by indirect and indeterminate 
(probabilistic) information about the groups to which the individual 
belongs. If an individualâs test results are known, for instance, no 
additional insight is provided by statistical inferences about the test 
results that <em>might have been expected</em> based on group profiling.
 An Ashkenazi Jewish moron is no less moronic because he is an Ashkenazi
 Jew. Elderly Chinese nuns are unlikely to be murderers, but a murderer 
who happens to be an elderly Chinese nun is neither more nor less 
murderous than one who is not. This is all extremely obvious, to 
obnoxious people.</p>
<p>To normal people, however, it is not obvious at all. In part this is 
because rational intelligence is scarce and abnormal among humans, and 
in part because social âintelligenceâ works with what everyone else is 
thinking, which is to say, with irrational groupish sentiment, meager 
information, prejudices, stereotypes, and heuristics. Since (almost) 
everybody else is taking short-cuts, or âeconomizingâ on reason, it is 
only rational to react defensively to generalizations that are likely to
 be reified or inappropriately applied â over-riding or substituting for
 specific perceptions. Anybody who anticipates being pre-defined through
 a group identity has an expanded ego-investment in that group and the 
way it is perceived. A generic assessment, however objectively arrived 
at, will immediately become personal, under (even quite remotely) normal
 conditions.</p>
<p>Obnoxious reason can stubbornly insist that <em>anything average cannot be about you</em>,
 but the message will not be generally received. Human social 
âintelligenceâ is not built that way. Even supposedly sophisticated 
commentators blunder repeatedly into the most jarring exhibitions of 
basic statistical incomprehension without the slightest embarrassment, 
because embarrassment was designed for something else (and for almost 
exactly the opposite). The failure to understand stereotypes in their 
scientific, or probabilistic application, is a functional prerequisite 
of sociability, since the sole alternative to idiocy in this respect is 
obnoxiousness.</p>
<p>Derbyshireâs article is noteworthy because it succeeds in being <em>definitively obnoxious</em>,
 and has been recognized as such, despite the spluttering incoherence of
 most rejoinders. Among the things that âthe talkâ and âthe 
counter-talkâ share is a theatrical structure of<em> pseudo-private conversation designed to be overheard</em>.
 In both cases, a message that parents are compelled to deliver to their
 children is staged as the vehicle for a wider social lesson, aimed at 
those who, through action or inaction, have created a world that is 
intolerably hazardous to them.</p>
<p>This form is intrinsically manipulative, making even the âoriginalâ 
talk a tempting target of parody. In the original, however, a tone of 
anguished sincerity is engineered through a deliberate performance of 
innocence (or ignorance). Listen son, I know this will be difficult to 
understand â¦ (<em>Oh why, oh why are they doing this to us?</em>). The 
counter-talk, in stark contrast, melds its micro-social drama with the 
clinically non-sociable discourse of âmethodical inquiries in the human 
sciencesâ â treating populations as fuzzy bio-geographical units with 
quantifiable characteristics, rather than as legal-political subjects in
 communication. It derides innocence, and â by implication â the 
criterion of sociability itself. Agreement, agreeableness, count for 
nothing. The rigorously and redundantly compiled statistics say what 
they say, and if we cannot live with that, so much the worse for us.</p>
<p>Yet even to a reasonably sympathetic, or scrupulously obnoxious, 
reading, Derbyshireâs article provides grounds for criticism. For 
instance, and from the beginning, it is notable that the racial 
reciprocal of ânonblack Americansâ is âblack Americansâ, not âAmerican 
blacksâ (the term Derbyshire selects). This reversal of word order, 
switching nouns and adjectives, quickly settles into a pattern. Does it 
matter that Derbyshire requests the extension of civility to any 
âindividual blackâ (rather than to âblack individualsâ)? It certainly 
makes a difference. To say that someone is âblackâ is to say something 
about them, but to say that someone is âa blackâ is to say who they are.
 The effect is subtly, yet distinctly, menacing, and Derbyshire is too 
well-trained, algebraically, to be excused from noticing it. After all, 
âJohn Derbyshire is a whiteâ sounds equally off, as does any analogous 
formulation, submerging the individual in the genus, to be retrieved as a
 mere instance, or example.</p>
<p>The more intellectually substantive aspect of this over-reach into gratuitous incivility have been examined by <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/human_nature/2012/04/john_derbyshire_trayvon_martin_and_the_ignorance_of_racial_profiling_.html">William Saletan</a> and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.theamericanconservative.com/millman/2012/04/09/a-quick-word-on-the-derb/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=a-quick-word-on-the-derb">Noah Millman</a>,
 who make very similar points, from the two sides of the 
liberal/conservative divide. Both writers identify a fissure or 
methodical incongruity in Derbyshireâs article, stemming from its 
commitment to the micro-social application of macro-social statistical 
generalizations. Stereotypes, however rigorously confirmed, are <em>essentially</em> inferior to specific knowledge in any concrete social situation, because nobody ever encounters a population.</p>
<p>As a liberal of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_nature/features/2007/created_equal/liberalcreationism.html">problematic standing</a>,
 Saletan has no choice but to recoil melodramatically from Derbyshireâs 
âstomach-turning conclusions,â but his reasons for doing so are not 
consumed by his gastro-emotional crisis. âBut what exactly is a 
statistical truth?â he asks. âItâs a probability estimate you might fall
 back on if you know nothing about [a particular individual]. Itâs an 
ignorant personâs weak substitute for knowledge.â Derbyshire, with his 
Aspergery attention to the absence of black Fields Medal winners, is ââ¦a
 math nerd who substitutes statistical intelligence for social 
intelligence. He recommends group calculations instead of taking the 
trouble to learn about the person standing in front of you.â</p>
<p>Millman emphasizes the ironic reversal that switches (obnoxious) social scientific knowledge into imperative ignorance:</p>
<blockquote><p>The ârace realistsâ like to say that they are the ones 
who are curious about the world, and the âpolitically correctâ types are
 the ones who prefer to ignore ugly reality. But the advice Derbyshire 
gives to his children encourages them not to be too curious about the 
world around them, for fear of getting hurt. And, as a general rule, 
thatâs terrible advice for kids â and not the advice that Derbyshire has
 followed in his own life.</p></blockquote>
<p>Millmanâs conclusion is also instructive:</p>
<blockquote><p>So why am I arguing with Derb at all? Well, because heâs a
 friend. And because even lazy, socially-irresponsible talk deserves to 
be refuted, not merely denounced. Is Derbyshireâs piece racist? <em>Of course itâs racist.</em>
 His whole point is that it is both rational and morally right for his 
children to treat black people significantly differently from white 
people, and to fear them. But âracistâ is a descriptive term, not a 
moral one. The ârace realistâ crowd is strongly convinced of the 
accuracy of Derbyshireâs major premises, and they are not going to be 
argued out of that conviction by the assertion such conviction is 
âracistâ â nor, honestly, should they be. For that reason, I feel itâs 
important to argue that Derbyshireâs conclusions do not follow simply 
from those premises, and are, in fact, morally incorrect even if those 
premises are granted for the sake of argument.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>In a sense weâve come to our nationâs capital to cash a check. 
When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the 
Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a 
promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a
 promise that all men â yes, black men as well as white men â would be 
guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness.<br>
It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note 
insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this
 sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a 
check that has come back marked âinsufficient funds.â</em><br>

<p><em>Conservatism â¦ is a white peopleâs movement, a scattering of outliers notwithstanding.<br>
Always has been, always will be. I have attended at least a hundred

the National Review offices for twelve years, and the only black person I
 saw there, other than when Herman Cain came calling, was Alex, the guy

This isnât because conservatism is hostile to blacks and mestizos. Very 
much the contrary, especially in the case of Conservatism Inc. They fawn
 over the occasional nonwhite with a puppyish deference that fairly fogs
 the air with embarrassment. (Q: What do you call the one black guy at a
 gathering of 1,000 Republicans? A: âMr. Chairman.â)<br>
Itâs just that conservative ideals like self-sufficiency and minimal 
dependence on government have no appeal to underperforming minorities â 
groups who, in the statistical generality, are short of the attributes 
that make for group success in a modern commercial nation.<br>
Of what use would it be to them to embrace such ideals? They would end 
up even more decisively pooled at the bottom of society than they are 
currently.<br>
A much better strategy for them is to ally with as many disaffected 
white and Asian subgroups as they can (homosexuals, feminists, dead-end 
labor unions), attain electoral majorities, and institute big

<p><em>African-Americans are the conscience of our country.</em><br>
â commenter âsurfedâ <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://blogs.the-american-interest.com/wrm/2012/05/14/academic-claptrap-and-its-consequences/">at</a> Walter Russell Meadâs blog (edited for spelling)</p>
<p>Americaâs racial âoriginal sinâ was foundational, dating back before 
the birth of the United States to the clearing of aboriginal peoples by 
European settlers, and â still more saliently â to the institution of 
chattel slavery. This is the Old Testament history of American 
black-white relations, set down in a providential narrative of escape 
from bondage, in which factual documentation and moral exhortation are 
indissolubly fused. The combination of prolonged and intense social 
abuse in a pattern set by the Torah, recapitulating the primordial 
moral-political myth of the Western tradition, has installed the story 
of slavery and emancipation as the unsurpassable frame of the American 
historical experience: <em>let my people go</em>.</p>
<p>âPractically Historicalâ (cited above), quotes Lincoln on the Civil War:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth 
piled by the bondsmanâs two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil 
shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall 
be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand 
years ago, so still it must be said âthe judgments of the Lord are true 
and righteous altogether.â</p></blockquote>
<p>The New Testament of race in America was written in the 1960s, 
revising and specifying the template. The combination of the Civil 
Rights Movement, the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, and the 
Republican Southern Strategy (appealing to disaffected whites in the 
states of the old Confederacy) forged a partisan identification between 
Blacks and the Democratic Party that amounted to a liberal-progressive 
rebirth, setting the terms for partisan racial polarization that have 
endured â and even strengthened â over subsequent decades. For a 
progressive movement compromised by a history of systematic eugenicist 
racism, and a Democratic Party traditionally aligned with white southern
 obduracy and the Ku Klux Klan, the civil rights era presented an 
opportunity for atonement, ritual purification, and redemption.</p>
<p>Reciprocally, for American conservatism (and its increasingly 
directionless Republican Party vehicle), this progression spelt 
protracted death, for reasons that continue to elude it. The Idea of 
America was now inextricable from a vehement renunciation of the past, 
and even of the present, insofar as the past still shaped it. Only an 
âever more perfect unionâ could conform to it. At the most superficial 
level, the broad partisan implications of the new order were 
unmistakable in a country that was becoming ever more democratic, and 
ever less republican, with effective sovereignty nationally concentrated
 in the executive, and the moral urgency of activist government 
installed as a principle of faith. For what had already become the âOld 
Rightâ there was no way out, or back, because the path backwards crossed
 the event horizon of the civil rights movement, into tracts of 
political impossibility whose ultimate meaning was slavery.</p>
<p>The left thrives on dialectics, the right perishes through them. 
Insofar as there is a pure logic of politics, it is that. One immediate 
consequence (repeatedly emphasized by Mencius Moldbug) is that 
progressivism has no enemies to the left. It recognizes only idealists, 
whose time has not yet come. Factional conflicts on the left are 
politically dynamic, celebrated for their motive potential. 
Conservatism, in contrast, is caught between a rock and a hard place: 
bludgeoned from the left by the juggernaut of post-constitutional 
statism, and agitated from âthe rightâ by inchoate tendencies which are 
both unassimilable (to the mainstream) and often mutually incompatible, 
ranging from extreme (Austro-libertarian) varieties of <em>laissez-faire</em>
 capitalist advocacy to strains of obstinate, theologically-grounded 
social traditionalism, ultra-nationalism, or white identity politics.</p>
<p>âThe rightâ has no unity, actual or prospective, and thus has no 
definition symmetrical to that of the left. It is for this reason that 
political dialectics (a tautology) ratchets only in one direction, 
predictably, towards state expansion and an increasingly coercive 
substantial-egalitarian ideal. The right moves to the center, and the 
center moves to the left.</p>
<p>Regardless of mainstream conservative fantasies, liberal-progressive 
mastery of American providence has become uncontestable, dominated by a 
racial dialectic that absorbs unlimited contradiction, whilst 
positioning the Afro-American underclass as the incarnate critique of 
the existing social order, the criterion of emancipation, and the sole 
path to collective salvation. No alternative structure of historical 
intelligibility is politically tolerable, or even â strictly speaking â 
imaginable, since resistance to the narrative is un-American, 
anti-social, and (of course) racist, serving only to confirm the 
existence of systematic racial oppression through the symbolic violence 
manifested in its negation. To argue against it is already to prove it 
correct, by concretely demonstrating the same benighted forces of social
 retardation that are being verbally denied. By resisting the demand for
 orchestrated social re-education, knuckle-dragging âbitter clingersâ 
only show how much there still is to do.</p>
<p>At its most abstract and all-encompassing, the liberal-progressive 
racial dialectic abolishes its outside, along with any possibility of 
principled consistency. It asserts â at one and the same time â that 
race does not exist, and that its socially-constructed pseudo-existence 
is an instrument of inter-racial violence. Racial recognition is both 
mandatory, and forbidden. Racial identities are meticulously catalogued 
for purposes of social remedy, hate crime detection, and disparate 
impact studies, targeting groups for âpositive discriminationâ, 
âaffirmative actionâ, or âdiversity promotionâ (to list these terms in 
their rough order of historical substitution), even as they are 
denounced as meaningless (by the United Nations, no less), and dismissed
 as malicious stereotypes, corresponding to nothing real. Extreme racial
 sensitivity and absolute racial desensitization are demanded 
simultaneously. Race is everything and nothing. There is no way out.</p>
<p>Conservatism is dialectically incompetent by definition, and so 
abjectly clueless that it imagines itself being able to exploit these 
contradictions, or â in its deluded <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.johnderbyshire.com/Opinions/HumanSciences/racistelites.html">formulation</a> â <em>liberal cognitive dissonance</em>.
 The conservatives who triumphantly point out such inconsistencies seem 
never to have skimmed the output of a contemporary humanities program, 
in which thick rafts of internally conflicted victimage are lovingly 
woven out of incompatible grievances, in order to exult in the radical 
progressive promise of their discordant lamentations. Inconsistency is 
fuel for the Cathedral, demanding activist argumentation, and ever 
heightened realizations of unity. <em>Integrative public debate always moves things to the left</em>
 â that might not seem an especially difficult point to grasp, but to 
understand it is to expose the fundamental futility of mainstream 
conservatism, and that is in almost nobodyâs interest, so it will not be
 understood.</p>
<p>Conservatism is incapable of working dialectics, or simultaneous 
contradiction, but that does not prevent it from serving progress (on 
the contrary). Rather than celebrating the power of inconsistency, it 
stumbles through contradictions, decompressed, in succession, in the 
manner of a fossil exhibition, and a foil. After âstanding athwart 
history, yelling âStop!ââ during the Civil Rights Era, and thus 
banishing itself eternally to racial damnation, the conservative (and 
Republican) mainstream reversed course, seizing upon Martin Luther King 
Jr. as an integral part of its canon, and seeking to harmonize itself <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/sns-mlk-ihaveadream,0,36081.story">with</a> âa dream deeply rooted in the American dream.â</p>
<blockquote><p>I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and 
live out the true meaning of its creed: âWe hold these truths to be 
self-evident, that all men are created equal.â<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of 
former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit 
down together at the table of brotherhood.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state 
sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of 
oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a 
nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by 
the content of their character.</p></blockquote>
<p>Captivated by Kingâs appeal to constitutional and biblical 
traditionalism, by his rejection of political violence, and by his 
uninhibited paeans to freedom, American conservatism gradually came to 
identify with his dream of racial reconciliation and race blindness, and
 to accept it as the true, providential meaning of its own most sacred 
documents. At least, this became the mainstream, public, conservative 
orthodoxy, even though it was consolidated far too late to neutralize 
suspicions of insincerity, failed almost entirely to convince the black 
demographic itself, and would remain open to escalating derision from 
the left for its empty formalism.</p>
<p>So compelling was Kingâs restatement of the American Creed that, 
retrospectively, its triumph over the political mainstream seems simply 
inevitable. The further American conservatism departed from the Masonic 
rationalism of the founders, in the direction of biblical religiosity, 
the more indistinguishable its faith became from a Black American 
experience, mythically articulated through Exodus, in which the basic 
framework of history was an escape from bondage, borne towards a future 
in which âall of Godâs children â black men and white men, Jews and 
Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics â will be able to join hands and 
sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual: âFree at last! Free at 
last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!ââ</p>
<p>The genius of Kingâs message lay in its extraordinary power of 
integration. The flight of the Hebrews from Egypt, the American War of 
Independence, the abolition of chattel slavery in the wake of the 
American Civil War, and the aspirations of the civil rights era were 
mythically compressed into a single archetypal episode, perfectly 
consonant with the American Creed, and driven forwards not only by 
irresistible moral force, but even by divine decree. The measure of this
 integrative genius, however, is the complexity it masters. A century 
after the âjoyous daybreakâ of emancipation from slavery, King declares,
 âthe Negro still is not free.â</p>
<blockquote><p>One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still 
sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of 
discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely 
island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. 
One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of
 American society and finds himself an exile in his own land.</p></blockquote>
<p>The story of <em>Exodus</em> is exit, the War of Independence is 
exit, and the emancipation from slavery is exit, especially when this is
 exemplified by the Underground Railroad and the model of 
self-liberation, escape, or flight. To be âmanacledâ by segregation, 
âchainedâ by discrimination, trapped on a âlonely island of povertyâ, or
 âexiledâ in oneâs âown landâ, in contrast, has no relation to <em>exit</em> whatsoever, beyond that which spell-binding metaphor can achieve. There is no <em>exit</em>
 into social integration and acceptance, equitably distributed 
prosperity, public participation, or assimilation, but only an 
aspiration, or a dream, hostage to fact and fortune. As the left and the
 reactionary right were equally quick to notice, insofar as this dream 
ventures significantly beyond a right to formal equality and into the 
realm of substantial political remedy, it is one that the right has no 
right to.</p>
<p>In the immediate wake of the John Derbyshire affair, Jessica Valenti at <em>The Nation</em> blog <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.thenation.com/blog/167290/who-cares-about-john-derbyshire">makes</a> the point clearly:</p>
<blockquote><p>â¦ this isnât just about who has written what â itâs about
 the intensely racist policies that are par for the conservative course.
 Some people would like to believe that racism is just the explicit, 
said-out-loud discrimination and hatred that is easily identifiable. 
Itâs not â itâs also pushing xenophobic policies and supporting systemic
 inequality. After all, whatâs more impactful â a singular racist like 
Derbyshire or Arizonaâs immigration law? A column or voter suppression? 
Getting rid of one racist from one publication doesnât change the fact 
that the conservative agenda is one that disproportionately punishes and
 discriminates against people of color. So, Iâm sorry, folks â you donât
 get to support structural inequality and then give yourself a pat on 
the back for not being overtly racist.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The âconservative agendaâ cannot ever be dreamy (hopeful and 
inconsistent) enough to escape accusations of racism â thatâs intrinsic 
to the way the racial dialectic works. Policies broadly compatible with 
capitalistic development, oriented to the rewarding of low 
time-preference, and thus punishing impulsivity, will reliably have a 
disparate impact upon the least economically functional social groups. 
Of course, the dialectic demands that the racial aspect of this 
disparate impact can and must be strongly emphasized (for the purpose of
 condemning incentives to human capital formation as racist), and at the
 same time forcefully denied (in order to denounce <em>exactly the same observation</em>
 as racist stereotyping). Anyone who expects conservatives to navigate 
this double-bind with political agility and grace must somehow have 
missed the late 20th century. For instance, the <del>doomed loser idiots</del> conservatives at the<em> Washington Examiner</em>, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://campaign2012.washingtonexaminer.com/blogs/beltway-confidential/house-dems-trained-make-race-issue/537146">noticing</a> with alarm that:</p>
<blockquote><p>House Democrats received training this week on how to 
address the issue of race to defend government programs â¦ The prepared 
content of a Tuesday presentation to the House Democratic Caucus and 
staff indicates that Democrats will seek to portray apparently neutral 
free-market rhetoric as being charged with racial bias, conscious or 
unconscious.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are no alternative versions of an ever more perfect union, 
because union is the alternative to alternatives. Searching for where 
the alternatives might once have been found, where liberty still meant <em>exit</em>,
 and where dialectics were dissolved in space, leads into a clown-house 
of horrors, fabricated as the shadow, or significant other, of the 
Cathedral. Since the right never had a unity of its own, it was given 
one. Call it the Cracker Factory.</p>
<p>When James C. Bennett, in <em>The Anglosphere Challenge</em>, sought 
to identify the principal cultural characteristics of the 
English-speaking world, the resulting list was generally familiar. It 
included, besides the language itself, common law traditions, 
individualism, comparatively high-levels of economic and technological 
openness, and distinctively emphatic reservations about centralized 
political power. Perhaps the most striking feature, however, was a 
marked cultural tendency to settle disagreements in space, rather than 
time, opting for territorial schism, separatism, independence, and 
flight, in place of revolutionary transformation within an integrated 
territory. When Anglophones disagree, they have often sought to 
dissociate in space. Instead of an integral resolution (regime change), 
they pursue a plural irresolution (through regime division), 
proliferating polities, localizing power, and diversifying systems of 
government. Even in its present, highly attenuated form, this 
anti-dialectical, de-synthesizing predisposition to social 
disaggregation finds expression in a stubborn, sussurous hostility to 
globalist political projects, and in a vestigial attraction to 
federalism (in its fissional sense).</p>
<p>Splitting, or fleeing, is all <em>exit</em>, and (non-recuperable) 
anti-dialectics. It is the basic well-spring of liberty within the 
Anglophone tradition. If the function of a Cracker Factory is to block 
off all the exits, thereâs only one place to build it â right here.</p>
<p>Like Hell, or Auschwitz, the Cracker Factory has a simple slogan inscribed upon its gate: <em>Escape is racist</em>.
 That is why the expression âwhite flightâ â which says exactly the same
 thing â has never been denounced for its political incorrectness, 
despite the fact that it draws upon an ethnic statistical generalization
 of the kind that would, in any other case, provoke paroxysms of 
outrage. âWhite flightâ is no more âwhiteâ than low time-preference is, 
but this broad-brush insensitivity is deemed acceptable, because it 
structurally supports the Cracker Factory, and the indispensable 
confusion of ancient (or negative) liberty with original (racial) sin.</p>
<p>You absolutely, definitely, mustnât go <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/groups/league-of-the-south">there</a> â¦ so, of course, we will â¦ [next]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a id="part4d"><strong> Part 4d: Odd Marriages</strong></a></p>
<p>The origins of the word âcrackerâ as a term of ethnic derision are 
distant and obscure. It seems to have already circulated, as a slur 
targeting poor southern whites of predominantly Celtic ancestry, in the 
mid-18th century, derived perhaps from âcorn-crackerâ or the Scots-Irish
 âcrackâ (banter). The rich semantic complexion of the term, 
inextricable from the identification of elaborate racial, cultural, and 
class characteristics, is comparable to that of its unmentionable dusky 
cousin â âthe â<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2012/06/gwyneth_paltrow_and_niggas_in_paris_is_it_ever_ok_for_white_people_to_use_the_word_.html">N-</a>â <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://glpiggy.net/2012/06/12/it-wont-stop/">word</a>â
 â and draws from the same well of generally recognized but forbidden 
truths. In particular, and emphatically, it testifies to the <em>illicit truism</em>
 that people are more excited and animated by their differences than by 
their commonalities, âclinging bitterlyâ â or at least tenaciously â to 
their non-uniformity, and obstinately resisting the universal categories
 of enlightened population management. Crackers are grit in the 
clockwork of progress.</p>
<p>The most delectable features of the slur, however, are entirely 
fortuitous (or Qabbalistic). âCrackersâ break codes, safes, organic 
chemicals â sealed or bonded systems of all kinds â with eventual 
geopolitical implication. They anticipate a <em>crack-up</em>, schism or
 secession, confirming their association with the anathematized 
disintegrative undercurrent of Anglophone history. No surprise, then â 
despite the linguistic jumps and glitching â that the figure of the 
recalcitrant cracker evokes a still-unpacified South, insubordinate to 
the manifest destiny of Union. This returns it, by short-circuit, to the
 most problematic depths of its meaning.</p>
<p><em>Contradictions</em> demand resolution, but <em>cracks</em> can 
continue to widen, deepen, and spread. According to the cracker ethos, 
when things can fall apart â itâs OK. Thereâs no need to reach 
agreement, when itâs possible to split. This <em>cussedness</em>, 
pursued to its limit, tends to a hill-billy stereotype set in a shack or
 rusting trailer at the end of an Appalachian mountain path, where all 
economic transactions are conducted in cash (or moonshine), interactions
 with government agents are conducted across the barrel of a loaded 
shotgun, and timeless anti-political wisdom is summed in the 
donât-tread-on-me reflex: âGet off my porch.â Naturally, this disdain 
for integrative debate (dialectics) is coded within the mainstream of 
Anglocentric global history â which is to say, Yankee evangelical 
Puritanism â as a deficiency not only of cultural sophistication, but 
also of basic intelligence, and even the most scrupulous adherent of 
social constructivist righteousness immediately reverts to 
hard-hereditarian psychometrics when confronted by cracker 
obstreperousness. To those for whom a broad trend of socio-political 
progress seems like a simple, incontestable fact, the refusal to 
recognize anything of the kind is perceived as clear evidence of 
retardation.</p>
<p>Since stereotypes generally have high statistical truth-value, itâs 
more than possible that crackers are clustered heavily on the left of 
the white IQ bell-curve, concentrated there by generations of dysgenic 
pressure. If, as Charles Murray argues, the efficiency of meritocratic 
selection within American society has steadily risen and conspired with 
assortative mating to transform class differences into genetic castes, 
it would be passing strange if the cracker stratum were to be 
characterized by conspicuous cognitive elevation. Yet some awkwardly 
intriguing questions intervene at this point, as long as one diligently 
pursues the stereotype. Assortative mating? How can that work, when 
crackers marry their cousins? Oh yes, thereâs <em>that</em>. Drawing on population groups beyond the north-western <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://hbdchick.wordpress.com/2012/02/06/medieval-manoralism-and-the-hajnal-line/">Hajnal</a> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://jayman.blog.com/2012/06/14/more-on-farming-and-inheritance-systems-part-i-iq/">Line</a>, traditional cracker kinship patterns are notably atypical of the exogamous Anglo (WASP) norm.</p>
<p>The tireless â<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://hbdchick.wordpress.com/">hbdchick</a>â is the crucial resource on this topic. Over the course of a truly monumental series of blog <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://hbdchick.wordpress.com/start-here/">posts</a>, she employs <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._D._Hamilton">Hamiltonian</a>
 conceptual tools to investigate the borderland where nature and culture
 intersect, comprising kinship structures, the differentiations they 
require in the calculus of inclusive fitness, and the distinctive ethnic
 profiles in the evolutionary psychology of altruism that result. In 
particular, she directs attention to the abnormality of (North-West) 
European history, where obligatory exogamy â through rigorous 
proscription of cousin marriage â has prevailed for 1,600 years. This 
distinctive orientation towards outbreeding, she suggests, plausibly 
accounts for a variety of bio-cultural peculiarities, the most 
historically significant of which is a unique pre-eminence of reciprocal
 (over familial) altruism, as indicated by emphatic individualism, 
nuclear families, an affinity with âcorporateâ (kinship-free) 
institutions, highly-developed contractual relationships among 
strangers, relatively low levels of nepotism / corruption, and robust 
forms of social cohesion independent of tribal bonds.</p>
<p>Inbreeding, in contrast, creates a selective environment favoring 
tribal collectivism, extended systems of family loyalty and honor, 
distrust of non-relatives and impersonal institutions, and â in general â
 those âclannishâ traits which mesh uncomfortably with the leading 
values of (Eurocentric) modernity, and are thus denounced for their 
primitive âxenophobiaâ and âcorruptionâ. Clannish values, of course, are
 bred in clans, such as those populating Britainâs Celtic fringe and 
borderlands, where cousin marriage persisted, along with its associated 
socio-economic and cultural forms, especially herding (rather than 
farming), and a disposition towards extreme, vendetta-style <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://hbdchick.wordpress.com/2012/01/27/culture-of-honor/">violence</a>.</p>
<p>This analysis introduces the central paradox of âwhite identityâ, 
since the specifically European ethnic traits that have structured the 
moral order of modernity, slanting it away from tribalism and towards 
reciprocal altruism, are inseparable from a unique heritage of 
outbreeding that is intrinsically corrosive of ethnocentric solidarity. 
In other words: it is almost exactly weak ethnic groupishness that makes
 a group ethnically modernistic, competent at âcorporateâ (non-familial)
 institution building, and thus objectively privileged / advantaged 
within the dynamic of modernity.</p>
<p>This paradox is most fully expressed in the radical forms of European
 ethnocentric revivalism exemplified by paleo- and neo-Nazism, 
confounding its proponents and antagonists alike. When exceptionally 
advanced ârace-treacheryâ is your quintessential racial feature, the 
opportunity for viable ethno-supremacist politics disappears into a 
logical abyss â even if occasions for large-scale trouble-making no 
doubt remain. Admittedly, a Nazi, by definition, is willing (and eager) 
to sacrifice modernity upon the altar of racial purity, but this is 
either not to understand, or to tragically affirm, the inevitable 
consequence â which is to be out-modernized (and thus defeated). 
Identity politics is for losers, inherently and unalterably, due to an 
essentially parasitical character that only works from the left. Because
 inbreeding systematically contra-indicates for modern power, racial <em>Ãbermenschen</em> make no real sense.</p>
<p>In any case, however endlessly fascinating Nazis may be, they are not any kind of reliable key to the history or direction of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.amazon.com/Cracker-Culture-Celtic-Ways-South/dp/0817304584">cracker culture</a>,
 beyond setting a logical limit to the programmatic construction and 
usage of white identity politics. Tattooing swastikas on their foreheads
 does nothing to change that. (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://hbdchick.wordpress.com/2012/05/31/hatfields-and-mccoys/">Hatfields vs McCoys</a> is more Pushtun than Teuton.)</p>
<p>The conjunction taking place in the Cracker Factory is quite 
different, and far more perplexing, entangling the urbane, cosmopolitan 
advocates of hyper-contractarian marketization with romantic 
traditionalists, ethno-particularists, and nostalgics of the âLost 
Causeâ. It is first necessary to understand this entanglement in its

<p>â¦ perhaps thatâs enough to be going on with (although thereâs plenty 
more within easy reach). These points have been selected, questionably, 
crudely, and prejudicially, to lend impressionistic support to a single 
basic thesis: <em>fundamental socio-historical forces are crackerizing libertarianism</em>.</p>
<p>If the tentative research conclusions drawn by hbdchick are accepted 
as a frame, the oddity of this marriage between libertarian and 
neo-confederate themes is immediately apparent. When positioned on a 
bio-cultural axis, defined by degrees of outbreeding, the absence of 
overlap â or even proximity â is dramatically exposed. One pole is 
occupied by a radically individualistic doctrine, focused 
near-exclusively upon mutable networks of voluntary interchange of an 
economic type (and notoriously insensitive to the very existence of 
non-negotiable social bonds). Close to the other pole lies a rich 
culture of local attachment, extended family, honor, contempt for 
commercial values, and distrust of strangers. The distilled rationality 
of fluid capitalism is juxtaposed to traditional hierarchy and 
non-alienable value. The absolute prioritization of <em>exit</em> is jumbled amongst folkways from which no exit is even imaginable.</p>
<p>Stapling the two together, however, is a simple, ever more 
irresistible conclusion: liberty has no future in the Anglophone world 
outside the prospect of secession. The coming crack-up is the only way 
out.</p>

<p>Conceived generically, modernity is a social condition defined by an 
integral trend, summarized as sustained economic growth rates that 
exceed population increases, and thus mark an escape from normal 
history, caged within the Malthusian trap. When, in the interest of 
dispassionate appraisal, analysis is restricted to the terms of this 
basic quantitative pattern, it supports sub-division into the (growth) 
positive and negative components of the trend: techno-industrial 
(scientific and commercial) contributions to accelerating development on
 the one hand, and socio-political counter-tendencies towards the 
capture of economic product by democratically empowered rent-seeking 
special interests on the other (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.jonathanrauch.com/jrauch_articles/demosclerosis_the_original_article/">demosclerosis</a>).
 What classical liberalism gives (industrial revolution) mature 
liberalism takes away (via the cancerous entitlement state). In abstract
 geometry, it describes an S-curve of self-limiting runaway. As a drama 
of liberation, it is a broken promise.</p>
<p>Conceived particularly, as a singularity, or real <em>thing</em>, 
modernity has ethno-geographical characteristics that complicate and 
qualify its mathematical purity. It came from somewhere, imposed itself 
more widely, and brought the worldâs various peoples into an 
extraordinary range of novel relations. These relations were 
characteristically âmodernâ if they involved an overflowing of previous 
Malthusian limits, enabling capital accumulation, and initiating new 
demographic trends, but they conjoined concrete groups rather than 
abstract economic functions. At least in appearance, therefore, 
modernity was something done by people of a certain kind with, and not 
uncommonly to (or even against), other people, who were conspicuously 
unlike them. By the time it was faltering on the fading slope of the 
S-curve, in the early 20th century, resistance to its generic features 
(âcapitalistic alienationâ) had become almost entirely indistinguishable
 from opposition to its particularity (âEuropean imperialismâ and âwhite
 supremacyâ). As an inevitable consequence, the modernistic 
self-consciousness of the systemâs ethno-geographical core slid <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://library.flawlesslogic.com/pound.htm">towards</a> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.toqonline.com/blog/lothrop-stoddard-and-the-rising-tide-of-color/">racial</a> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://greatmindsonrace.wordpress.com/2011/10/02/h-p-lovecraft/">panic</a>, in a process that was only arrested by the rise and immolation of the Third Reich.</p>
<p>Given modernityâs inherent trend to degeneration or 
self-cancellation, three broad prospects open. These are not strictly 
exclusive, and are therefore not true alternatives, but for schematic 
purposes it is helpful to present them as such.</p>
<p>(1) Modernity 2.0. Global modernization is re-invigorated from a new 
ethno-geographical core, liberated from the degenerate structures of its
 Eurocentric predecessor, but no doubt confronting long range trends of 
an equally mortuary character. This is by far the most encouraging and 
plausible scenario (from a pro-modernist perspective), and if China 
remains even approximately on its current track it will be assuredly 
realized. (India, sadly, seems to be too far gone in its native version 
of demosclerosis to seriously compete.)</p>
<p>(2) Postmodernity. Amounting essentially to a new dark age, in which 
Malthusian limits brutally re-impose themselves, this scenario assumes 
that Modernity 1.0 has so radically globalized its own morbidity that 
the entire future of the world collapses around it. If the Cathedral 
âwinsâ this is what we have coming.</p>
<p>(3) Western Renaissance. To be reborn it is first necessary to die, 
so the harder the âhard rebootâ the better. Comprehensive crisis and 
disintegration offers the best odds (most realistically as a sub-theme 
of option #1).</p>
<p>Because competition is good, a pinch of Western Renaissance would 
spice things up, even if â as is overwhelmingly probable â Modernity 2.0
 is the worldâs principal highway to the future. That depends upon the 
West stopping and reversing pretty much everything it has been doing for
 over a century, excepting only scientific, technological, and business 
innovation. It is advisable to maintain rhetorical discipline within a 
strictly hypothetical mode, because the possibility of any of these 
things is deeply colored by incredibility:</p>
<p>(1) Replacement of representational democracy by constitutional republicanism (or still more <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://distributedrepublic.net/archives/2008/12/18/rampant-moldbuggery">extreme</a> anti-political governmental mechanisms).</p>
<p>(2) Massive downsizing of government and its rigorous confinement to core functions (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.daviddfriedman.com/The_Machinery_of_Freedom_.pdf">at most</a>).</p>
<p>(3) Restoration of hard money (precious metal coins and bullion deposit notes) and abolition of central banking.</p>
<p>(4) Dismantling of state monetary and fiscal discretion, thus 
abolishing practical macroeconomics and liberating the autonomous (or 
âcatallacticâ) economy. (This point is redundant, since it follows 
rigorously from 2 &amp; 3 above, but itâs the real prize, so worth 
emphasizing.)</p>
<p>Thereâs more â which is to say, less politics â but itâs already 
absolutely clear that none of this is going to happen short of an 
existential civilizational cataclysm. Asking politicians to limit their 
own powers is a non-starter, but nothing less heads even remotely in the
 right direction. This, however, isnât even the widest or deepest 
problem.</p>
<p>Democracy might begin as a defensible procedural mechanism for 
limiting government power, but it quickly and inexorably develops into 
something quite different: a culture of systematic thievery. As soon as 
politicians have learnt to buy political support from the âpublic 
purseâ, and conditioned electorates to embrace looting and bribery, the 
democratic process reduces itself to the formation of (Mancur Olsonâs) 
âdistributional coalitionsâ â electoral majorities mortared together by 
common interest in a collectively advantageous pattern of theft. Worse 
still, since people are, on average, not very bright, the scale of 
depredation available to the political establishment far exceeds even 
the demented sacking that is open to public scrutiny. Looting the 
future, through currency debauchment, debt accumulation, growth 
destruction, and techno-industrial retardation is especially easy to 
conceal, and thus reliably popular. Democracy is essentially tragic 
because it provides the populace with a weapon to destroy itself, one 
that is always eagerly seized, and used. Nobody ever says ânoâ to free 
stuff. Scarcely anybody even sees that there is no free stuff. Utter 
cultural ruination is the necessary conclusion.</p>
<p>Within the final phase of Modernity 1.0, American history becomes the
 master narrative of the world. It is there that the great Abrahamic 
cultural conveyor culminates in the secularized neo-puritanism of the 
Cathedral, as it establishes the New Jerusalem in Washington DC. The 
apparatus of Messianic-revolutionary purpose is consolidated in the 
evangelical state, which is authorized by any means necessary to install
 a new world order of universal fraternity, in the name of equality, 
human rights, social justice, and â above all â <em>democracy</em>. The 
absolute moral confidence of the Cathedral underwrites the enthusiastic 
pursuit of unrestrained centralized power, optimally unlimited in its 
intensive penetration and its extensive scope.</p>
<p>With an irony altogether hidden from the witch-burnersâ spawn 
themselves, the ascent of this squinting cohort of grim moral fanatics 
to previously unscaled heights of global power coincides with the 
descent of mass-democracy to previously unimagined depths of gluttonous 
corruption. Every five years America steals itself from itself again, 
and fences itself back in exchange for political support. <em>This democracy thing is easy â you just vote for the guy who promises you the most stuff. An idiot could do it.</em> Actually, it likes idiots, treats them with apparent kindness, and does everything it can to manufacture more of them.</p>
<p>Democracyâs relentless trend to degeneration presents an implicit 
case for reaction. Since every major threshold of socio-political 
âprogressâ has ratcheted Western civilization towards comprehensive 
ruin, a retracing of its steps suggests a reversion from the society of 
pillage to an older order of self-reliance, honest industry and 
exchange, pre-propagandistic learning, and civic self-organization. The 
attractions of this reactionary vision are evidenced by the vogue for 
18th century attire, symbols, and constitutional documents among the 
substantial (Tea Party) minority who clearly see the disastrous course 
of American political history.</p>
<p>Has the âraceâ alarm sounded in your head yet? It would be amazing if
 it hadnât. Stagger back in imagination before 2008, and the fraught 
whisper of conscience is already questioning your prejudices against 
Kenyan revolutionaries and black Marxist professors. Remain in reverse 
until the Great Society / Civil Rights era and the warnings reach 
hysterical pitch. Itâs perfectly obvious by this point that American 
political history has progressed along twin, interlocking tracks, 
corresponding to the <em>capacity</em> and the <em>legitimation</em> of 
the state. To cast doubt upon its scale and scope is to simultaneously 
dispute the sanctity of its purpose, and the moral-spiritual necessity 
that it command whatever resources, and impose whatever legal 
restraints, may be required to effectively fulfill it. More 
specifically, to recoil from the magnitude of Leviathan is to 
demonstrate insensitivity to the immensity â indeed, near infinity â of 
inherited racial guilt, and the sole surviving categorical imperative of
 senescent modernity â government needs to <em>do more</em>. The 
possibility, indeed near certainty, that the pathological consequences 
of chronic government activism have long ago supplanted the problems 
they originally targeted, is a contention so utterly maladapted to the 
epoch of democratic religion that its practical insignificance is 
assured.</p>
<p>Even on the left, it would be extraordinary to find many who 
genuinely believe, after sustained reflection, that the primary driver 
of government expansion and centralization has been the burning desire <em>to do good</em>
 (not that intentions matter). Yet, as the twin tracks cross, such is 
the electric jolt of moral drama, leaping the gap from racial Golgotha 
to intrusive Leviathan, that skepticism is suspended, and the great 
progressive myth installed. <em>The alternative to more government, doing ever more, was to stand there, negligently, whilst they lynched another Negro.</em> This proposition contains the entire essential content of American progressive education.</p>
<p>The twin historical tracks of state capability and purpose can be 
conceived as a translation protocol, enabling any recommended restraint 
upon government power to be âdecodedâ as malign obstruction of racial 
justice. This system of substitutions functions so smoothly that it 
provides an entire vocabulary of (bipartisan) âcode-wordsâ or 
âdog-whistlesâ â âwelfareâ, âfreedom of associationâ, âstates rightsâ â 
ensuring that any intelligible utterance on the Principal (left-right) 
Political Dimension occupies a double registry, semi-saturated by racial
 evocations. Reactionary regression smells of strange fruit.</p>
<p>â¦ and that is before backing out of the calamitous 20th century. It 
was not the Civil Rights Era, but the âAmerican Civil Warâ (in the terms
 of the victors) or âWar between the Statesâ (in those of the 
vanquished) that first indissolubly cross-coded the practical question 
of Leviathan with (black/white) racial dialectics, laying down the 
central junction yard of subsequent political antagonism and rhetoric. 
The indispensable primary step in comprehending this fatality snakes 
along an awkward diagonal between mainstream statist and revisionist 
accounts, because the conflagration that consumed the American nation in
 the early 1860s was wholly but non-exclusively about emancipation from 
slavery and about <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://dixienet.org/rights/whatisstatesrights10252010.shtml">states rights</a>,
 with neither âcauseâ reducible to the other, or sufficient to suppress 
the warâs enduring ambiguities. Whilst there are any number of 
âliberalsâ happy to celebrate the consolidation of centralized 
government power in the triumphant Union, and, symmetrically, a (far 
smaller) number of neo-confederate apologists for the institution of 
chattel slavery in the southern states, neither of these unconflicted 
stances capture the dynamic cultural legacy of a <em>war across the codes</em>.</p>
<p>The war is a knot. By practically dissociating liberty into <em>emancipation</em> and <em>independence</em>,
 then hurling each against the other in a half-decade of carnage, blue 
against gray, it was settled that freedom would be broken on the 
battlefield, whatever the outcome of the conflict. Union victory 
determined that the emancipatory sense of liberty would prevail, not 
only in America, but throughout the world, and the eventual reign of the
 Cathedral was assured. Nevertheless, the crushing of Americanâs second 
war of secession made a mockery of the first. If the institution of 
slavery de-legitimated a war of independence, what survived of 1776? The
 moral coherence of the Union cause required that the founders were 
reconceived as politically illegitimate white patriarchal slave-owners, 
and American history combusted in progressive education and the culture 
wars.</p>
<p>If independence is the ideology of slave-holders, emancipation 
requires the programmatic destruction of independence. Within a 
cross-coded history, the realization of freedom is indistinguishable 
from its abolition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a id="part4f"><strong> Part 4f: Approaching the Bionic Horizon</strong></a></p>
<p>Itâs time to bring this long digression to a conclusion, by reaching 
out impatiently towards the end. The basic theme has been mind control, 
or thought-suppression, as demonstrated by the Media-Academic complex 
that dominates contemporary Western societies, and which Mencius Moldbug
 names the Cathedral. When things are squashed they rarely disappear. 
Instead, they are displaced, fleeing into sheltering shadows, and 
sometimes turning into monsters. Today, as the suppressive orthodoxy of 
the Cathedral comes unstrung, in various ways, and numerous senses, a 
time of monsters is approaching.</p>
<p>The central dogma of the Cathedral <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/steen/cogweb/ep/EP-primer.html">has</a> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.vdare.com/articles/john-harvey-s-race-and-equality-the-standard-social-science-model-is-w-r-o-n-g">been</a>
 formalized as the Standard Social Scientific Model (SSSM) or âblank 
slate theoryâ. It is the belief, completed in its essentials by the 
anthropology of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.anthropology.wisc.edu/pdfs/Passion_of_Franz_Boas.pdf">Franz Boas</a>, that every legitimate question about mankind is restricted to the sphere of culture. Nature permits <em>that</em> âmanâ is, but never determines <em>what</em>
 man is. Questions directed towards natural characteristics and 
variations between humans are themselves properly understood as cultural
 peculiarities, or even pathologies. Failures of ânurtureâ are the only 
thing we are allowed to see.</p>
<p>Because the Cathedral has a consistent ideological orientation, and 
sifts its enemies accordingly, comparatively detached scientific 
appraisal of the SSSM easily veers into raw antagonism. As Simon 
Blackburn <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.powells.com/review/2002_11_21.html">remarks</a> (in a thoughtful review of Steven Pinkerâs <em>The Blank Slate</em>),
 âThe dichotomy between nature and nurture rapidly acquires political 
and emotional implications. To put it crudely, the right likes genes and
 the left likes culture â¦â</p>
<p>At the limit of reciprocal loathing, hereditarian determinism 
confronts social constructivism, with each committed to a radically 
pared-back model of causality. <em>Either</em> nature expresses itself as culture, <em>or</em>
 culture expresses itself in its images (âconstructionsâ) of nature. 
Both of these positions are trapped at opposite sides of an incomplete 
circuit, structurally blinded to <em>the culture of practical naturalism</em>, which is to say: the techno-scientific / industrial manipulation of the world.</p>
<p>Acquiring knowledge and using tools is a single dynamic circuit, 
producing techno-science as an integral system, without real 
divisibility into theoretical and practical aspects. Science develops in
 loops, through experimental <em>technique</em> and the production of 
ever more sophisticated instrumentation, whilst embedded within a 
broader industrial process. Its advance is the improvement of a machine.
 This intrinsically technological character of (modern) science 
demonstrates the <em>efficiency</em> of culture as a complex natural 
force. It neither expresses a pre-existing natural circumstance, nor 
does it merely construct social representations. Instead, nature and 
culture compose a dynamic circuit, at the edge of nature, where fate is 
decided.</p>
<p>According to the self-reinforcing presupposition of modernization, to
 be understood is to be modifiable. It is to be expected, therefore, 
that biology and medicine co-evolve. The same historical dynamic that 
comprehensively subverts the SSSM through inundating waves of scientific
 discovery simultaneously volatilizes human biological identity through 
biotechnology. There is no essential difference between learning what we
 <em>really are</em> and re-defining ourselves as technological contingencies, or <em>technoplastic</em>
 beings, susceptible to precise, scientifically-informed 
transformations. âHumanityâ becomes intelligible as it is subsumed into 
the technosphere, where information processing of the genome â for 
instance â brings reading and editing into perfect coincidence.</p>
<p>To describe this circuit, as it consumes the human species, is to define our <em>bionic horizon</em>:
 the threshold of conclusive nature-culture fusion at which a population
 becomes indistinguishable from its technology. This is neither 
hereditarian determinism, nor social constructivism, but it is what both
 would have referred to, had they indicated anything real. It is a 
syndrome vividly anticipated by Octavia Butler, whose <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://biology.kenyon.edu/slonc/books/butler1.html">Xenogenesis</a>
 trilogy is devoted to the examination of a population beyond the bionic
 horizon. Her Oankali âgene tradersâ have no identity separable from the
 biotechnological program that they perpetually implement upon 
themselves, as they commercially acquire, industrially produce, and 
sexually reproduce their population within a single, integral process. 
Between what the Oankali are, and the way they live, or behave, there is
 no firm difference. Because they make themselves, their nature is their
 culture and (of course) reciprocally. What they <em>are</em> is exactly what they <em>do</em>.</p>
<p>Religious traditionalists of the Western Orthosphere are right to 
identify the looming bionic horizon with a (negative) theological event.
 Techno-scientific auto-production specifically supplants the fixed and 
sacralized essence of man as a created being, amidst the greatest 
upheaval in the natural order since the emergence of eukaryotic life, 
half a billion years ago. It is not merely an evolutionary event, but 
the threshold of a new <em>evolutionary phase</em>. John H. Campbell heralds the emergence of <em>Homo autocatalyticus</em>, whilst <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.neoeugenics.net/camp.htm">arguing</a>: âIn point of fact, it is hard to imagine how a system of inheritance could be more ideal for engineering than ours is.â</p>
<p>John H. Campbell? â a prophet of monstrosity, and the perfect excuse for a monster quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Biologists suspect that new forms evolve rapidly from 
very tiny outgroups of individuals (perhaps even a single fertilized 
female, Mayr, 1942) at the fringe of an existing species. There the 
stress of an all but uninhabitable environment, forced inbreeding among 
isolated family members, âintrogressionâ of foreign genes from 
neighboring species, lack of other members of the species to compete 
against or whatever, promotes a major reorganization of the genomic 
program, possibly from modest change in gene structure. Nearly all of 
these transmogrified fragments of species die out, but an occasional one
 is fortunate enough to fit a new viable niche. It prospers and expands 
into a new species. Its conversion into a statistically constrained gene
 pool then stabilizes the species from further evolutionary change. 
Established species are far more notable for their stasis than change. 
Even throwing off a new daughter species does not seem to change an 
existing species. No one denies that species can gradually transform and
 do so to various extents, but this so-called âanagenesisâ is relatively
 unimportant compared to geologically-sudden major saltation in the 
generation of novelty.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Three implications are important.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
1. Most evolutionary change is associated with the origin of new species.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
2. Several modes of evolution may operate simultaneously. In this case the most effective dominates the process.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
3. Tiny minorities of individuals do most of the evolving instead of the species as a whole.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
A second important characteristic of evolution is self-reference 
(Campbell, 1982). The Cartesian cartoon of an autonomous external 
âenvironmentâ dictating the form of a species like a cookie cutter 
cutting stencils from sheets of dough is dead, dead wrong. The species 
molds its environment as profoundly as the environment âevolvesâ the 
species. In particular, the organisms cause the limiting conditions of 
the environment over which they compete. Therefore the genes play two 
roles in evolution. They are the targets of natural selection and they 
also ultimately induce and determine the selection pressures that act 
upon them. This circular causality overwhelms the mechanical character 
of evolution. Evolution is dominated by feedback of the evolved 
activities of organisms on their evolution.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The third seminal realization is that evolution extends past the change 
in organisms as products of evolution to change in the process itself. 
Evolution evolves (Jantsch, 1976; Balsh, 1989; Dawkins, 1989; Campbell, 
1993). Evolutionists know this fact but have never accorded the fact the
 importance that it deserves because it is incommensurate with 
Darwinism. Darwinists, and especially modern neodarwinists, equate 
evolution to the operation of a simple logical principle, one that is 
prior to biology: Evolution is merely the Darwinian principle of natural
 selection in action, and this is what the science of evolution is 
about. Since principles cannot change with time or circumstances, 
evolution must be fundamentally static.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Of course, biological evolution is not like this at all. It is an actual
 complex process, not a principle. The way that it takes place can, and 
indisputably does, change with time. This is of utmost importance 
because the process of evolution advances as it proceeds (Campbell, 
1986). Preliving matter in the earthâs primordial soup was able to 
evolve only by subdarwinian âchemicalâ mechanisms. Once these puny 
processes created gene molecules with information for their 
self-replication then evolution was able to engage natural selection. 
Evolution then wrapped the self-replicating genomes within 
self-replicating organisms to control the way that life would respond to
 the winds of selection from the environment. Later, by creating 
multicellular organisms, evolution gained access to morphological change
 as an alternative to slower and less versatile biochemical evolution. 
Changes in the instructions in developmental programs replaced changes 
in enzyme catalysts. Nervous systems opened the way for still faster and
 more potent behavioral, social and cultural evolution. Finally, these 
higher modes produced the prerequisite organization for rational, 
purposeful evolution, guided and propelled by goal-directed minds. Each 
of these steps represented a new emergent level of evolutionary 
capability.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Thus, there are two distinct, but interwoven, evolutionary processes. I 
call them âadaptive evolutionâ and âgenerative evolution.â The former is
 familiar Darwinian modification of organisms to enhance their survival 
and reproductive success. Generative evolution is entirely different. It
 is the change in a process instead of structure. Moreover, that process
 is ontological. Evolution literally means âto unfoldâ and what is 
unfolding is the capacity to evolve. Higher animals have become 
increasingly adept at evolving. In contrast, they are not the least bit 
fitter than their ancestors or the lowest form of microbe. Every species
 today has had exactly the same track record of survival; on average, 
every higher organism alive today still will leave only two offspring, 
as was the case a hundred million years ago, and modern species are as 
likely to go extinct as were those in the past. Species cannot become 
fitter and fitter because reproductive success is not a cumulative 
parameter.</p></blockquote>
<p>For racial nationalists, concerned that their grandchildren should 
look like them, Campbell is the abyss. Miscegenation doesnât get close 
to the issue. <em>Think face tentacles.</em></p>
<p>Campbell is also a secessionist, although entirely undistracted by 
the concerns of identity politics (racial purity) or traditional 
cognitive elitism (eugenics). Approaching the bionic horizon, 
secessionism takes on an altogether wilder and more monstrous bearing â 
towards <em>speciation</em>. The folks at euvolution <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.euvolution.com/eugenics/radical_intervention.html">capture</a> the scenario well:</p>
<blockquote><p>Reasoning that the majority of humankind will not 
voluntarily accept qualitative population-management policies, Campbell 
points out that any attempt to raise the IQ of the whole human race 
would be tediously slow. He further points out that the general thrust 
of early eugenics was not so much species improvement as the prevention 
of decline. Campbellâs eugenics, therefore, advocates the abandonment of
 Homo sapiens as a ârelicâ or âliving fossilâ and the application of 
genetic technologies to intrude upon the genome, probably writing novel 
genes from scratch using a DNA synthesizer. Such eugenics would be 
practiced by elite groups, whose achievements would so quickly and 
radically outdistance the usual tempo of evolution that within ten 
generation the new groups will have advanced beyond our current form to 
the same degree that we transcend apes.</p></blockquote>
<p>When seen from the bionic horizon, whatever emerges from the 
dialectics of racial terror remains trapped in trivialities. Itâs time 
to move on.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Thereâs a simple answer here. A 
debate stopper right up front. There is a more dominant global meme than
 Progressive Democracy / Cathedral. Itâs the most libertarian of things,
 its called Digital Socialism.</p>
<p>The libertarian fundamentally shifts between aggressive Atomic 
Property rights and aggressive Digital Socialism â and weâve done so 
instinctively as hackers / pirates since Digital began.</p>
<p>If it can be copied, it cannot be be owned, and we should (policy) 
not, and ought (moral) not try fight this genius meme. Owned is an 
atomic construct, it is zero sum, you or I have the dirty old shoe. If 
we could copy oil if we could copy food, weâd only have land left to 
fight over â and geo-libertarians get this right too.</p>
<p>My god men, the most fundamental piece of economics is what? 
Scarcity. Unlimited wants, limited means. And that law is now just one 
half of the coin.</p>
<p>Jason, Digital Socialism (the Internet) has given us gay marriage in 
15 years. Digital Socialism means we need less law, less govt. 
protection. It means, if we had the Internet in 1945, we wouldnât have 
needed DC.</p>
<p>And while it seems impossible to get todayâs society to that grok that argumentâ¦</p>
<p>(I have this for) Nick, over the next 15 years, digital socialism 
will reduce the number of public employees in the US to 5M from 22M. And
 THAT dear boy, is how the public sector ruling class and itâs elected 
officials, are DESTROYED from the inside, like any good dominant meme 
is.</p>
<p>Right now the left has their political campaigns funded by tax 
dollars â pay checks from public employees. Similarly Public employees 
do not actually pay income taxes â it is an accounting fraud.</p>
<p>Without paid soldier$, whats the left to do?</p>
<p>Promise more free sh*t than us?</p>
<p>Uhm, who can promise more free sh*t than US? Free movies, free 
Harvard classes, free songs, even free smartphones and bandwidth (apps 
are how we shut down govt offices thru humane attrition).</p>
<p>And notice, whoâs âstuffâ is being socialized? The earning centers of the left elite.</p>
<p>Iâll throw some links in here later, but notice Jurvetson talking 
about atomic things all costing $1 per pound. Thatâs you owning your 
atomics and getting free 3D designs and reconfiguring them to your 
hearts content.</p>
<p>Mainly, I want to get to this â I have SOLVED the race, welfare, 
immigration thing â it is called Guaranteed Income / Choose Your Boss 
and it is built to unite the Tea Party, the Congressional Black Caucus 
and OWS. I tackle directly how to create trust in multicultural systems,
 and do it by taking down the man.</p>
<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230203200419/http://www.morganwarstler.com/post/44789487956/guaranteed-income-choose-your-boss-the-market-based" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.morganwarstler.com/post/44789487956/guaranteed-income-choose-your-boss-the-market-based</a></p>
<p>Note I simply take the work of Friedman and Murray and improve on it 
by using what they couldnât possibly foresee, but since Digital 
Socialism, it is all super obvious.</p>
<p>Finally, the libertarian synthesis to get rid of HBD is simply this. 
Profits are made by looking under rocks in places people are not looking
 to find ROI.</p>
<p>The fewer people mining for gold, the more profits there are for the libertarians who donât exit.</p>
<p>Thereâs a bigger badder ass meme in town boys, stop fretting about the old dying one.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Asserted:  âFirstly, it is essential to squash the democratic myth that a state âbelongsâ to the citizenry.â</p>
<p>We await with bated breath:  âThe point of neo-cameralism is to buy 
out the real stakeholders in sovereign power, not to perpetuate 
sentimental lies about mass enfranchisement.â</p>
<p>Let me try to reword this for clarity:  âIn reality there is no de 
jure  ârightâ â there is simply the de facto power structure obscured by
 the lies about the de jure â lies told to the citizenry â lies that are
 part of the power structure.  The point of neo-cameralism is to align 
the de jure with the de facto so that public discourse about the State 
becomes meaningful.â</p>
<p>But this means the power structure must give up one of its principle 
powers:  The power of lies it tells to the citizenry about their 
supposed âownershipâ.</p>
<p>It is this precise feature of the power structure â that it is dependent on massive fraud â that is its weakness.</p>
<p>Think about it like this:</p>
<p>If your power structure is based on pheromone-like manipulation of 
the hiveâs masses to go after this or that target, but you forget that 
the forms you are using as your pheromones actually have residual 
communicative, as opposed to manipulative, meaning â you are vulnerable 
to the communicative as opposed to manipulative application of those 
same forms.</p>
<p>So letâs take this notion of the business that is owned by the 
citizenry as an example:  The citizenry is lead to the subconscious 
attitude that they own the State and this attitude is cultivated while 
obscuring it beneath the distracting machinery of politics, bureaucracy,
 religion, academia and media.  This is equivalent to the managers of a 
corporation issuing fraudulent statements to its stockholders.  Clearly 
one of the chief means by which these âstockholdersâ can be manipulated â
 particularly if they notice that in some vague sense they are being 
screwed â is to go on witch hunts to âexpose the fraudâ, thereby having 
the stockholders attack anyone who may actually be exposing the fraud.  
Agreed, there is a point at which this system is irretrievably lost to 
management, and you may as well issue a new class of stock that more 
accurately represents the power to manipulate the stockholders (which of
 course means the holders of the original class of stock end up with 
devalued stock and very little of the new class of stock).</p>
<p>However, arenât we really just talking about power stratagems here?  
Doesnât it at some point become more powerful to appeal to the carefully
 cultivated sense of ownership felt by the citizenry so that, rather 
than issuing a new class of stock to reflect reality, the lie that they 
are enfranchised is transformed into truth through âprosecution of 
fraudâ?</p>

<p>Everybody says there is this RACE problem. Everybody says this RACE 
problem will be solved when the third world pours into EVERY white 
country and ONLY into white countries.</p>
<p>The Netherlands and Belgium are just as crowded as Japan or Taiwan, 
but nobody says Japan or Taiwan will solve this RACE problem by bringing
 in millions of third worlders and quote assimilating unquote with them.</p>
<p>Everybody says the final solution to this RACE problem is for EVERY 
white country and ONLY white countries to âassimilate,â i.e., 
intermarry, with all those non-whites.</p>
<p>What if I said there was this RACE problem and this RACE problem 
would be solved only if hundreds of millions of non-blacks were brought 
into EVERY black country and ONLY into black countries?</p>
<p>How long would it take anyone to realize Iâm not talking about a RACE
 problem. I am talking about the final solution to the BLACK problem?</p>
<p>And how long would it take any sane black man to notice this and what kind of psycho black man wouldnât object to this?</p>
<p>But if I tell that obvious truth about the ongoing program of 
genocide against my race, the white race, Liberals and respectable 
conservatives agree that I am a naziwhowantstokillsixmillionjews.</p>
<p>They say they are anti-racist. What they are is anti-white.</p>
<p>Anti-racist is a code word for anti-white.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>To advocate that government be a 
certain way, without the willingness to pay the price to make it that 
certain way, is to worship at the altar of socialism. Political 
entrepreneurship is the only way to forge a path through the political 
jungle. What is politics? Politics is war, pure and simple. What is war?
 Itâs the manipulation of the will of others to support our own, pure 
and simple. Let me make this more explicit. The common word for 
âpolitical entrepreneurshipâ today is **organized crime**. The pacifist,
 secessionist mentality is inherently avoidant of the critical issue 
that there is a cost to maintaining sovereignty. The invention of the 
atomic bomb has certainly been a vastly disruptive technology in this 
regard, one which nobody should ever ignore. However, upon reaching the 
end of this writing, I remembered something crucial. War is not limited 
to members of your own species. We need to subjugate the wolf and the 
cow, to either exterminate or enslave them, not because we are evil, but
 because the alternative is to be subjugated by them. To surrender the 
fields to the cows and retreat in fear. Fuck, there is just too much 
stuff bouncing around in my head now. Fuckâ¦ fuckâ¦ fuck! Peace is a lie, 
there is only passion, through passion I gain strength, through strength
 I gain power, through power I gain victory, through victory my chains 
are broken, the force shall free me.</p>

 a deep philosophic audience here, he is writing a general introduction 
to a cluster of political views with an eye towards conditions they are 
embedded within.  Nicks reference of spatiality as the colonial solution
 to conflict actually contains here a nuanced reference to the 
philosophical tradition and specifically hegelâs weakness in treating 
space (aka conceptless â ie dilectics free â EXTERIORITY)</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I like this.  Iâve been waiting for a
 long time for dissidents to develop a coherent analysis of the 
orthodoxy of this miserable age.  I think that being able to critique 
the system for what it is, rather than a Jewish/Marxist plot might prove
 to be advantageous; somehow.</p>
<p>I have a theory that the ever increasing pressure applied by the 
zealots of the cult of Modernity must produce a stimulating effect on 
their opponents/victims.  This âDark Enlightenmentâ milieu would seem to
 be evidence for such a mechanism in operation.  </p>
<p>having said that, kinda disappointing that having nailed 
progressivism as the mainspring of this insanity, and having identified 
its weakness as an all encompassing intellectual paradigm, we end up 
with a techno-utopian/dystopian prediction.  The arrival of squid faced 
halo-esque supermen in ten generations time to either save us from âThe 
cathedralâ, or whatever remains by the time it is done, or wipe us out 
is one of those rogue asteroid problems.   If that happens then nothing 
we do or say makes any difference at all and we may as well not bother 
even thinking about this stuff, or anything else.  Sounds a bit like 
âtheyâll think of somethingâ (so I donât have to), one of 
progressivismâs  greatest hits.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Charon, yeah sure I get that, and if 
we learned anything from Karl M it is that a good critique does not 
necessarily imply a good solution.</p>
<p>Iâve only just begun exploring the âDark Enlightenmentâ.  I just read
 Moldburgâs âopen letter to open minded progressivesâ, all fourteen 
parts (glad I wasnât paying the postage).  Looks to me like high end 
âNew Rightâ/âAltrightâ.  Participation in that milieus battle for 
control of the right poll of the âspectrumâ would seem the most obvious 
strategy.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Iâd be interested in having a look at
 your work too. Any way to view it online? Western artists are equalist 
fags nearly to a man, while powerful art is an excellent persuasive tool
 and cultural ennobler/unifier. The soul of contemporary western artists
 of course limits the potential grandeur of their works. Such art 
requires a certain cultural soil in which to flourish. The genes for 
great art in the west are there, yet no great artists, mostly just 
pompous equalist fuckbags whose art is average independent of subject 
matter (i.e. on strictly technical grounds).</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Fascinating article. </p>
<p>Itâs strange, though, it says different things depending on how you 
read it. It seems like it could be an argument either for or against the
 neoreactionary ideaâ¦ or altogether different.</p>
<p>I basically read âall of human civilization is screwed because of 
inherent contradictions, some of which superficially lend credence to 
reactionary viewpoints, and none of it matters because weâll be replaced
 by creatures with face tentacles.â</p>
<p>I must be the only one to find this vaguely amusing.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>the major thrust of the DE is anti 
democracy, but barely any democractic processes exist in reality. the 
presidential seat hardly pushes FDR like policies of massive social 
reform programs, there is no USSR to counter as there was at that time. 
Congressional seats are held already as micro fiefdoms and the 
posteriors in those seats remain often for decades. much of the state 
apperutus is appointed like a corporation. democracy seems less of a 
danger than the rising social powder keg of a pool of labor which will 
be replaced by automated systems, and the new social peril of lone wolf 
terrorism weapon technology offers to those socially alienated by 
âsocialâ media technology; less social bonds irl more media based 
interactions, where are the social clubs, the pool halls etc? democracy 
is not really a mechanical componet of how civilazation works but an 
adjunct at maintaining how it works: its the label on the package, the 
advert, the lolipop at the bank. structurally it does little, already we
 have a drift towards technocracy, and corporation based ownership of 
the meta systems. likely those two things will continue quite happily 
with the masses voting, while less and less true mass ruptures happen. 
Alla BLM in Ferguson, the state liquidates political oppenets on the 
left fairly easily with out much outcry, while Nike can coopt major 
league figures into the myth. globalism and universalism are inherent 
features of capitalism from its start. its clear the proletarian 
envisioned by Marx et al has failed to materialize as the revolutionary 
protagâ but that doesnt mean history is telological, civilation doesnt 
at all time require a push, a revolution. its most likely we will simply
 live through a dull consolidation of power more and more by those 
structures which can consolidate power already existing. if a ruling 
stratum can transhumanify amd become gods that might be about it. or if 
China has some major change to export its model that results in politcal
 revolutions through its growing spheres. but a rational restructuring 
of civilization will not happen. that assumes there is what existed in 
France or America etc during the Enlightenment, a new social class, with
 a new technological system for the first time, coupled with massive 
labor disciplinings that came prior in the form of massive systematic 
brutality: witch trials , ethnic cleansing, pathogen depop etc. there is
 just choas all around and the biggest growing megamachine ever. we have
 no control with or with out democracy for what is instore for. 
multicuturalism etc are a teporary phase which will be a foot note at a 
one world massive technological system which will chug along until the 
physical, social material is so thouroughly exhuasted that the next 
thing is not political which replaces it but of an eitherly new species,
 be it rats or robots.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Revisiting this after reading it a 
few years ago, maybe in 2015? Interesting how back then this seemed like
 dark, forbidden material (Maybe the Moldbuggian aesthetics casting 
their halo, which managed to spook me back then). Now it seems concise, 
on-point. I donât want to underplay the creative brilliance at work, but
 my perception now is one of reading a solid diagnosis as opposed to 
dark, fractal insanity. Not sure what changed between now and then. I 
donât feel more radical.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Itâs pretty good, but he trips up and falls for egalitarianism in the end.</p>
<p>This is because Libertarianism is fundamentally flawed: it refuses 
any group-identity, such as ârace.â  It insists on the same universalism
 (âone humanityâ) that he spent 50 pages bashing.</p>
<p>Group-identity (and therefore group competition) is not going 
anywhere, even after the advent of the âbionic horizon.â  To think 
otherwise is egalitarian wishful thinking, worthy of the same scorn as 
egalitarian âequalityâ obsession.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Itâs rather disappointing that after 
all the cogent criticism of egalitarianism, the author in the end 
swallows the same old egalitarian Blue Pill, and says that itâs âtime to
 move onâ from racial âterrorâ since ârace doesnât matter.â</p>
<p>Please.  When the âbionic horizonâ arrives, it will be just like 
every other technological advancement: another way to compete.  Do you 
really think that genetic editing secrets are going to be shared between
 nations and races?  Really?  Are we all going to hold hands and sing in
 the post-biological world?</p>
<p>Nope, weâre going to struggle and compete and attempt to eradicate each other, just like we now.  </p>
<p>Indeed we will âspeciateâ â but when Whites (or some subpopulation of
 Whites) elevate themselves to something post-human, why the f*ck would 
they elevate Negroes (or anyone else) along with them?</p>
<p> As I always say: we made the mistake of bringing Negroes as cargo to
 the New World in 1619.  Letâs not make that mistake again.  When we 
finally leave planet Earth, we go alone.  No nonwhites come along, not 
even as cargo.  Let them âinherit the Earth.â</p>
